			<abstract>The Historical Transit Routes layer contains streetcar, horsecar, ferry, 1948 bus and steampower routes in the Twin Cities seven county metropolitan area.  One shape and one corresponding record exists for each dated route segment.

The line work for the dataset was developed by referencing the Metropolitan Council's functional class road dataset. 

Attributes include type, corridor, year start, year end, year restart and private right-of-way.  

For information comparing the different transit GIS datasets distributed by the Met. Council, please see http://www.datafinder.org/metadata/transit_data_overview.pdf .</abstract>
			<purpose>To identify all locations in the Twin Cities metropolitan area where horsecars, streetcars, ferries, steam powered and 1948 bus routes traveled.</purpose>

		<logic>This dataset contains one record and one polyLine shape for each dated route segment in the historical transit system.  In most cases, several of the individual line shapes overlap each other, and remain as overlapping components of the polyLine.  This can present problems when splitting out the individual components of the polyLine during editing processes, such as splitting or calculating length.</logic>
		<complete>Entire seven county transit area is covered.</complete>
		<posacc>
			<horizpa>
				<horizpar>Positional accuracy varies throughout the dataset.  Most line work was developed referencing the Metropolitan Council's Functional Class Road layer.

Text below taken from Functional Class Road metadata:

There are differing degrees of positional accuracy throughout the file. TLG adjusts the positional accuracy of the data to available sources known to have a greater degrees of accuracy then those used to generate the existing data. However, in all cases (including instances where COGO line work has been the reference) TLG generalizes the street segments to at least 4 feet in order to greatly reduce the number of vertices - thus reducing unnecessary file size and allowing for faster analysis.

TLG's goal is to have 95% of roads located to within the approximate center of digital right-of-way data or pavement centerlines provided from counties, where such digital data is available. In other areas, 95% of roads are intended to be within ten meters of the road or right-of-way center.</horizpar>
