			<abstract>The U.S. Census's 2010 LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistcs (LODES) Dataset was used to map job and worker density in throughout the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, Minnesota. The LODES data is part of the U.S. Census's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics program which records the number of jobs by workplace location and the number of workers by household location at the census block level. The census block level data was converted to a smoothly tapered surface of calculated census block value. The resulting data surface provides a general representation of overall employment density of jobs in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, Minnesota.</abstract>
			<purpose>Representing employment density as a smooth surface can users visualize areas of job concentration that might be difficult to interpret from discrete block-level data. </purpose>
			<supplinf>Twin Cities 7 county metropolitan area.  This includes the counties of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington.</supplinf>

				<procdesc>The LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistcs (LODES) Workplace Area Characteristic data was used to map low-wage job density throughout the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, Minnesota. The LODES data is part of the U.S. Census's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics program. Job totals were assigned to census block centroids and were converted to a smoothly tapered surface using Kernal Density in the Spatial Statistic Tools in ArcGIS. The data was converted to 1 acre grid cells (output cell size of 63.6 meters) with a 1 mile search radius.
