It was created by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.  This dataset was used in the Metropolitan Council's Blueprint 2030 and subsequent 2030 Regional Development Framework.  After the Blueprint was approved by the Council, the DNR provided a different dataset named Regionally Significan Ecological Areas http://www.datafinder.org/metadata/mndnr_eco_patches.htm .  Some significant differences exist between the two datasets.  DNR is only distributing the latter dataset.  The Metropolitan Council is distributing this dataset because it was used for the 2030 Regional Development Framework.

This metadata was taken in large part from DNR's metadata which is no longer available.

Individual forest, grassland and wetland models were integrated to identify and rank the Regionally Significant Natural Resource Areas. The Regionally Significant Natural Resource Area scores are determined by examining important ecological attributes of the natural resource patches, including size, shape, cover type diversity, adjacent land use.  The results represent a probability that the modeled conditions exist in any given area, due to limitations of the data layers.  

The dataset was created from LandSat land cover images.</abstract><purpose>The data is to help make regional scale land use decisions, especially as it relates to balancing development and natural resource protection.</purpose></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>2000</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><current>2000 LandSat images</current></timeperd><status><progress>In work</progress><update>None Planned</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-94.028865</westbc><eastbc>-92.722523</eastbc><northbc>45.420775</northbc><southbc>44.461089</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><place><placekey>Seven county metro</placekey></place><theme><themekey>ecology</themekey></theme></keywords><accconst>none</accconst><useconst>none</useconst><browse><browsen>http://www.datafinder.org/metadata/bg/Framework2030RegionalNaturalResourceAreas.jpg</browsen><browsed>Sample map showing the dataset</browsed></browse><crossref><citeinfo><title>Regionally Significant Ecological Areas http://www.datafinder.org/metadata/mndnr_eco_patches.htm</title></citeinfo></crossref><native>ArcGIS 9x</native><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntperp><cntorg>Metropolitan Council</cntorg><cntper>Paul Hanson</cntper></cntperp><cntpos>GIS Specialist</cntpos><cntaddr><address>390 Robert Street North</address><city>St. Paul</city><state>Minnesota</state><postal>55101</postal></cntaddr><cntvoice>651-602-1642</cntvoice><cntfax>651-602-1674</cntfax><cntemail>paul.hanson@metc.state.mn.us</cntemail></cntinfo></ptcontac></idinfo><dataqual><attracc><attraccr>No metadata available for attribute accuracy.</attraccr></attracc><lineage><procstep><procdesc>Very little information about the lineage was available.

Dataset was created running an Arc/Info AML on a GRID land cover dataset.

The dataset was created by running ecological models using 30 meter LandSat data.  The accuracy of this data is directly tied to the accuracy of the LandSat data.  The greatest LandSat interpretation error that affect this data pertains to tall grassland areas.</procdesc></procstep><srcinfo><srcscale /></srcinfo></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><indspref /><direct>Vector</direct><mgmg3obj>Polygon</mgmg3obj><mgmg3til>One dataset for entire metro area</mgmg3til></spdoinfo><eainfo><overview><eaover>Value:   ecological ranking of sites
