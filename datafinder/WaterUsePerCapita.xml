			<abstract>This dataset contains historic residential per capita water demand for 2004, 2005, and 2006 for each municipal water supply system in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. Data was compiled by the Metropolitan Council from Minnesota Department of Natural Resources supplemental water use information submitted annually by municipal water utilities.</abstract>
			<purpose>The 2005 Minnesota Legislature directed the Metropolitan Council to "carry out planning activities addressing the water supply needs of the metropolitan area" (Minnesota Statutes, Section 473.1565). Specifically the Council is charged with developing a base of technical information for water supply planning decisions and to prepare a metropolitan area master water supply plan. This dataset supports this charge.</purpose>
			<supplinf>Twin Cities Seven County Metropolitan Area. This includes the counties of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington in Minnesota.</supplinf>

			<current>Data is considered complete through 2005. Some 2006 data had not yet been reported at the time the data was compiled (August 2008).  Changes since 2006 only reflect minor adjustments to the municipal boundaries, reflected in the Time Period of Content.</current>
