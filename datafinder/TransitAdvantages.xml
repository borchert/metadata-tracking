The advantages have been categorized by type and include bus lanes, busways, commuter rail, HOT lanes, light rail, meter bypasses, online stations and shoulder lanes.  The line work for the dataset was derived from NCompass Technologies' Street Centerline dataset. A number of street segments were added to depict all transit advantages0.

Information in this layer is subject to changes and may not be fully accurate.  Refer to street signage and field conditions for the most accurate information.
