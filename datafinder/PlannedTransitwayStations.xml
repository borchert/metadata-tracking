			<abstract>This dataset depicts the location of planned transitway stations on future transitways which are in advanced design or under construction.  Currently, this file includes station locations for Southwest LRT (Green Line Extension), Bottineau LRT (Blue Line Extension) Cedar Avenue BRT Phase 2 (Red Line), I-35W BRT (Orange Line) and other planned Arterial BRT stations. 

Station points are placed on the general location of the future station. For transitways in early design, this could be as generalized as a point at the intersection. This file is not a guarantee of future station locations. This is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. Station locations subject to change without notice or warning. This file does not have any guaranteed measure of accuracy. 

The point dataset was created by using heads-up digitizing referencing aerial photography.
When transitway construction is completed and service begins, the stations will move from this file to TransitwayStations (existing). 

Additional Notes:
-  Red, Blue and Orange line station locations are managed by Rachel Wiken (see Section 7).  All other station locations are managed by:

- The A Line stations at Snelling &amp; Como will be located on the exit ramps, not in an online configuration as shown. The current point&#8217;s purpose is to show that there will be stations at Snelling and Como Avenues.

- Downtown Minneapolis and Saint Paul BRT station locations have yet to be determined. Stations shown are conceptual.

			<eaover>POINT ATTRIBUTES:

STATION:   The name of the transitway station.

****A Note about Bottineau Light Rail Stations**** 
Selection of either a Golden Valley Road Station * or Plymouth Avenue Station * will be made in the future based on information from environmental impact review, engineering, and public involvement. 

X:  The longitude in decimal degrees.

Y:  The latitude in decimal degrees.

Name: Name of the route which is served by the station

Type:  Type of route served by station

Transitway:  Transitway name

StationID: Existing shared station IDs match the StationID field in the TransitwayStations file.
Planned stations are labeled 900 and above.  Arterial BRT stations are labeled 999 until under construction. </eaover>
