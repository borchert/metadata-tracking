The lines are derived from the Functional Class Roads layer (also developed by the Metropolitan Council) and the Lawrence Group street centerline shapefile. Attributes include road name, type, highway number, and a code defining interstate highways (Y/N).

NOTES:
This layer is intended to be used just to show the major highways for reference and cartographic purposes. Since divided highways are represented with just one centerline, there are accuracy and scale limitations for using this layer.

Major highways were included if they met one of the following criterion:
1) An Interstate or U.S. Highway
or
2) A State Highway or County Road AND classified as a Principal Arterial by the Council's Functional Class Roads Layer</abstract><purpose>This layer is intended for use as a cartographic element to represent major highways on small scale maps of 1:50,000 or higher.  The ArcGIS layer file included with this shapefile also has embedded properties which allow the user to label the major highways with the appropriate highway shields using dynamic labels.</purpose><supplinf>Twin Cities seven county metropolitan area.

For divided highways, a single line was centered between the directional halves, using heads-up digitizing, usually at a scale of 1:5000 or 1:10,000 .  For undivided highways, TLG Street Centerlines were traced.  No ramps were included, and major highway intersections were represented by simplified splits to facilitate cartographic representations on small scale maps.</procdesc></procstep><srcinfo><srcscale /></srcinfo></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><indspref>None</indspref><direct>Vector</direct><mgmg3obj>line shapes</mgmg3obj><mgmg3til>One layer for entire metro area</mgmg3til></spdoinfo><eainfo><overview><eaover>LINE ATTRIBUTES:
