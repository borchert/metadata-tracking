The seven counties were assembled into a common coordinate system.  No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties.  A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county.  (See section 5 of the metadata).  The attributes are the same for the polygon and points layers.  Not all attributes are populated for all counties.

The polygon layer contains one record for each real estate/tax parcel polygon within each county's parcel dataset.  Some counties have polygons for each individual condominium, and others do not.  (See Completeness in Section 2 of the metadata for more information.)  The points layer includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset.  The points are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon.  The primary example of this is the condominium, though some counties stacked polygons for condos.  Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units.  Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset.  The points for the point dataset often will be randomly placed or stacked within the parcel polygon with which they are associated.  

The polygon layer is broken into individual county shape files.  The points layer is provided as both individual county files and as one file for the entire metro area.

In many places a one-to-one relationship does not exist between these parcel polygons or points and the actual buildings or occupancy units that lie within them.  There may be many buildings on one parcel and there may be many occupancy units (e.g. apartments, stores or offices) within each building.  Additionally, no information exists within this dataset about residents of parcels.  Parcel owner and taxpayer information exists for many, but not all counties.

Polygon and point counts for each county are as follows (based on the January 2012 dataset unless otherwise noted):

      polygons / points
Anoka - 129385 / 129385
Carver - 38699 / 38699
Dakota - 136792 / 150666 
Hennepin - 424702 / 424702
Ramsey - 148978 / 166846
Scott - 55227 / 55227
Washington - 106841 / 106841 

This is a MetroGIS Regionally Endorsed dataset.  (See http://www.metrogis.org/data/about/index.shtml#whatis for more information.)


Each of the seven Metro Area counties has entered into a multiparty agreement with the Metropolitan Council to assemble and distribute the parcel data for each county as a regional (seven county) parcel dataset.

Inclusion of Condominiums in Polygon Dataset:
Some counties include condominium information within their polygon dataset and others do not.  Some information on this topic is shown below.  Contact each county for further information.

Anoka:
Individual condominiums are included within the polygon dataset by subdividing the larger, common area parcel polygon of the condos into smaller polygons.  These smaller polygons do not represent the actual geography of the condominiums, but do lie within the larger condo parcel.

Carver, Hennepin and Scott
Individual condominiums are included within the polygon dataset using stacked polygons with the same geography for each condominium tax parcel.

Dakota, Ramsey and Washington
One polygon is included in the polygon dataset for the geography of the larger common area of a condominium building or complex.  Individual condominium units are only represented in the points dataset.

Note:  For Carver County, where a point represents a tax parcel that has multiple, noncontiguous polygons, a single point will be placed within one of the polygons.</complete><posacc><horizpa><horizpar>See the Data Quality section of the metadata for individual counties at the following links:

Note:  The last five digits of Dakota Counties PIN Numbers changed format in March of 2011
See .pdf above for further details.

A lookup table "ParcelsDakotaOldNewPINLookupTable2011.dbf" will be included in the Dakota County zip bundle that allows users to join parcel information which contain the old PIN format.  Users should be aware that the old and new PIN formats are not mutually exclusive to each other.  There are approximately 1,500 records of NEWPIN numbers that have the same PIN as OLDPIN number.
