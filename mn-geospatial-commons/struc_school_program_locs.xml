The FNS Office is in the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE).  GIS at MDE modified the data set using school building locations provided by the school districts and program locations from an MDE database. School District buildings are annually updated but there may remain errors due to the amount of program locations and the frequency with which they move from building to building in a District.

The records in this shapefile cover all school program locations that MDE currently has in a spatial format. Beginning in SY2009-10, separate files for different school programs (public, nonpublic, and charter, and public school district center) were combined into one file and attributes are used to distinguish the school types.  Note that multiple programs may occur at the same location and are represented as separate points. For example, a junior and a senior high school may be in the same building, but each has a separate record and point in the data layer.</abstract><purpose>MnGeo (formerly LMIC) and the Minnesota Department of Education have been in contact with Minnesota school districts since 1998, identifying school program locations. These locations are used by MDE to help identify where appropriate funds should be used for that school year. Beginning in 2006, MDE took over sole responsibility for all editing and metadata.</purpose><supplinf>Minnesota</supplinf><langdata Sync="TRUE">en</langdata></descript><timeperd><current>School year 2014-2015</current><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>2014</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>Annually</update></status><spdom><lboundng><leftbc Sync="TRUE">190972.952900</leftbc><rightbc Sync="TRUE">747256.479300</rightbc><bottombc Sync="TRUE">4817260.998400</bottombc><topbc Sync="TRUE">5468873.997700</topbc></lboundng><bounding><westbc>-97.250680</westbc><eastbc>-89.597207</eastbc><northbc>49.372570</northbc><southbc>43.444465</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekey>structure, school, public school, nonpublic school, non-public school, charter school, public school district center</themekey><themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt></theme><place><placekey>Minnesota, MN</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>In obtaining this data from MDE and MnGeo, it is understood that you and/or your organization have the right to use it for any purpose.

Locations are modified per request by the school district or through a process of checking locations against various sources (aerial photography, geocoding).

All other school locations (charters, nonpublic, post-secondary, etc.) were brought forward from database records at MDE and spatially located using address matching techniques and most current aerial photography (per previous paragraph).</attraccr></attracc><logic>Not applicable</logic><complete>Public and non-public school program locations in Minnesota.</complete><posacc><horizpa><horizpar>See Lineage.</horizpar></horizpa></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srcscale></srcscale></srcinfo><procstep><procdesc>The Land Management Information Center (LMIC, now MnGeo) created this data set for the Food and Nutrition Services Office (FNS) of the Minnesota Department of Education to help MDE determine eligibility status in the FNS food programs.

In 1998-99, LMIC provided maps to school districts and asked the districts to locate school buildings.  LMIC then digitized these points and added the school names that appeared on the maps to the database.  In order to add the ID used by CFL, LMIC obtained the public school database from the CFL webpage, rawdata.html, on 6/19/99.  It contained 2192 school site records.  The schools that were digitized from the maps were matched to the records in the public school database.  For those records that did not match any point, a point location was determined.  A variety of methods were used to locate these records including phone calls to the schools and address matching.

Note that these CFL records are for school programs and not school buildings.  Multiple programs may occur at the same location and are represented as separate points.  For example, a K-6 program and an alternative learning center, or a junior and a senior high school, may be in the same building, but each has a separate record and ID in the CFL database.  They will, therefore, have separate points in the data layer.  The records cover traditional K-12 programs as well as alternative learning centers and other special programs.

As part of the FNS project, the school districts have been asked each year to provide any changes to the educational facilities. The changes may include elimination of schools no longer in service, the addition of new schools and the correction of the schools' locations. The school districts mainly have provided changes to the traditional K-12 program locations.

Each year, LMIC made the changes provided by the school districts to the point file (the work for SY2002-2003 started with the SY1999-2000 database). In addition, the CFL public school database was retrieved from the CFL web site. All of the programs that matched by the ID_STRING to this database were identified. For the traditional K-12 programs, the attributes such as ID, address, school class and grades were compared to the CFL database. If there were any new traditional K-12 programs which were not provided by the school districts, a point location was determined and added to the data layer. All other programs that did not match to the CFL database were deleted. One should note that the CFL public school program database changes throughout the school year and other program changes could have occurred that are not reflected in these databases.

Work was not done to change any locations to programs not used by the FNS project or not identified by the school districts as a new or changed location.  This includes any programs that may been originally located based on the same address as one of the traditional K-12 programs and subsequently that K-12 program location was edited.

SY2002-2003 SUMMARY:
The PUBSCH03 point file is a fairly complete representation of the traditional K-12 public schools programs. The school districts have had the most input in providing, correcting and updating these locations, although there may still be some positional problems not yet identified.

SY2003-2004 SUMMARY:
Each year LMIC has sent a large format School District map (36 inches x 52 inches) to each school district. For SY2003-04, LMIC also included a larger scale map for each school in the District. By adding these larger scale maps, school administrators were able to more accurately mark the locations of each school.

SY2004-2005 SUMMARY:
Three attributes were added:  (LEVEL, SCH_TYPE, SCH_TYPE1) and one attribute name was changed (CFL_ID_STRING was changed to ORGID).

SY2005-2009 SUMMARY:
School locations were modified according to 2003 NAIP aerial phography from the Farm Service Agency:  http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/chouse/metadata/naip03.html . Each location was moved to match the photographic location.

SY2009-2010 SUMMARY: All school locations were brought into the same geodatabase spatial file. Locations were checked using prior methods. Differentiation of schools is made through reselection based on SCH_TYPE and SCH_TYPE1 or by UNI_TYPE attributes.

SY2010-2011 SUMMARY: Modified dataset using MDE's ORGUNIT school database. Added county code number.

SY2011-2012 Summary: Modified 35-50 district attendance boundaries based on annual distirct review.

SY2012-2013 Summary: Modified 40-50 district attendance boundaries based on annual district review.

SY2013-2014 Summary: Modified around 60 district attendance boundaries based on annual district review and county parcel information.

SY2014-2015 Summary: Modified around 45 district attendance boundaries based on annual district review. No parcel data was used in this update.</procdesc><proccont><cntinfo><cntperp><cntper>Scott Freburg</cntper><cntorg>Land Management Information Center</cntorg></cntperp><cntpos>Senior GIS

SCH_LEVEL - Attempt to identify those programs that are a "District" level program versus "School" level. Used mainly within the Minnesota Department of Education. "District" identification has NO UNI_IMD or UNI_MNR, meaning the last six numbers will be "000000". This designation only has a UNI_TYP or UNI_MAJ designated number. Main examples are:

1. School district offices have an ORGID of "000000" at the end because of the District designation. Examples  Minneapolis (030001000000), Fridley (010013000000) or St. Paul (010625000000).

2. Charter schools - Charters are their own district, therefore there is a location for each charter license that is "000 000". There may be 2, 3, 4 or more locations based on the charter but there will always be 1 record for each charter with these numbers. The charters may also be housed on a single location or in several locations. Examples:
  
   Metro Deaf (District)  07 4000 000 000, 1471 Brewster St., St. Paul
   Metro Deaf (School)  07 4000 010 000, 1471 Brewster St., St. Paul
   Metro Deaf (School)  07 4000 020 000, 1471 Brewster St., St. Paul

There are other schools with a "District' designation but District offices and Charter schools are the majority. To reselect all Charter schools by District you would use this identifier to reselect only those. If you want all charters but not the District designation, just locations, then reselect OUT the District designation.

ALT_NAME - If a building has a name (such as XXX Early Childhood Center), it may be easier for labeling purposes to label using this field versus labeling individual points. In some locations there are 2, 3, 4 or more programs at one location.
