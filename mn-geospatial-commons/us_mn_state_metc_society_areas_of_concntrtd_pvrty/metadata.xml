(In 2014, 185% of the federal poverty threshold was $44,826 for a family of four or $22,331 for an individual living alone.) Some census tracts that meet this poverty threshold have a large share of college or graduate students; we exclude these census tracts from our defined Areas of Concentrated Poverty.

To identify areas where people of color experience the most exposure to concentrated poverty, the Council further differentiates Areas of Concentrated Poverty where 50% or more of the residents are people of color (ACP50s).

Note that Metropolitan Council’s Areas of Concentrated Poverty are different than the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Racially / Ethnically Concentrated Areas of Poverty.

Because equity and access are critical underpinnings of the Sustainable Communities program, HUD required each grantee to complete a Fair Housing and Equity Assessment (FHEA). A Fair Housing and Equity Assessment involves analyses of a region’s racial and ethnic diversity, identifying what HUD describes as Racially Concentrated Areas of Poverty (RCAPs) and High Opportunity areas, describing public investments and policies as well as the jurisdiction’s fair housing landscape. This information, gathered through both community engagement and secondary data sources, provides a full picture of regional equity and access to opportunity. An FHEA also outlines how the resulting process and final product (i.e., the full report) will inform key public policies, such as regional planning.

The Council began work on its FHEA, titled Choice, Place and Opportunity: An Equity Assessment of the Twin Cities Region, in early 2012. Council staff consulted with external stakeholders (the FHEA Data and Mapping Team), engaged with community members (roundtable discussions in 2012 and 2013) and released two draft versions for public comment. In addition, the themes from the FHEA process infused the Thrive MSP 2040 policy development and engagement processes. This inclusive approach has allowed the Council to realize HUD’s goals for the Fair Housing and Equity Assessment. 

Choice, Place and Opportunity: An Equity Assessment of the Twin Cities Region reported that both economic and racial inequalities are limiting opportunities for residents who live in Areas of Concentrated Poverty (40% or more of the households earn incomes that are less than 185% of the federal poverty level). The report further states that race-specific barriers limits residential choices of people of color and hinders their ability to leave areas of concentrated poverty. Consequently, theses barriers feed existing racial disparities by creating and perpetuating Racially Concentrated Areas of Poverty (RCAPs), defined as census tracts where: 
•	50% or more of the residents are people of color and 
•	40% or more of the households earn incomes that are less than 185% of the federal poverty level.

Looking at the Twin Cities region as a whole, opportunities such as jobs, high-performing schools, and safe neighborhoods are unevenly distributed. Where people live influences their access to opportunities. Changing the uneven landscape of opportunity to enhance opportunity for all residents can help reduce both economic and racial inequities.
The report states that a region that shares both opportunities and challenges and seeks to improve the lives of its entire population is stronger and more vibrant. The Council hopes the report will raise awareness of the complex interdependencies of income, race, place, and opportunity and to challenge both itself and others to think regionally and act equitably for a better region for all. 

Upon completing the requirements of the Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant, local officials and advocacy groups have suggested that future dialog regarding opportunity and equity focus on Areas of Concentrated Poverty (40% or more of the households earn incomes that are less than 185% of the federal poverty level) or ACPs with additional awareness of Areas of Concentrated Poverty where 50% or more of the Residents are People of Color (a more accurate definition than the HUD defined RCAP term) or ACP50s.

It should also be noted that Areas of Concentrated Poverty where a large percentage of the residents were post-secondary students living in poverty were excluded from the defined areas.
