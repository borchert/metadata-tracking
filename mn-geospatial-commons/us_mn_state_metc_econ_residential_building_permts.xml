        <procdesc>The data were obtained through an annual survey sent to communities by the Metropolitan Council and from the U.S. Census Bureau. 

The data on returned surveys were verified by Metropolitan Council staff through various means including: contact with community staff, comparison to data from the Residential Construction Branch of the Manufacturing and Construction Division of the U.S. Census Bureau, community websites, and comparison to data submitted by communities in the Metropolitan Council's annual Livable Communities Act (LCA) survey. Data from the Residential Construction Branch of the Manufacturing and Construction Division of the U.S. Census Bureau were used if a community did not return the survey. 

Data may be periodically updated to reflect corrections. 

For this shapefile, only attached housing units are included. 

A small number of communities each year may not provide data. These are typically places with no residential construction occurring. 

Historical data may be available for the following places: 

Burns Township (became the city of Nowthen, July 2008) 
Chaska Township (merged with the city of Chaska, January 2005) 
Columbus Township (became the city of Columbus, September 2006) 
Elko (merged with the city of New Market to become Elko New Market, January 2007) 
Forest Lake Township (merged with the city of Forest Lake, March 2000) 
Grant Township (became the city of Grant, January 1997) 
Hassan Township (merged with the city of Rogers, January 1, 2012) 
New Market (merged with the city of Elko to become Elko New Market, January 2007) 
New Scandia Township (became the city of Scandia, January 2007) 
Norwood (merged with the city of Young America to become Norwood Young America, January 1997) 
Oak Grove Township (became the city of Oak Grove, December 1993) 
Young America (merged with the city of Norwood to become Norwood Young America, January 1997)

The data on returned surveys were verified by Metropolitan Council staff through various means including: contact with community staff, community websites, and comparison to data in the Council's Service Availability Charge (SAC) reports where possible. 

For this data, projects are counted at the time local units of government issue building permits.
