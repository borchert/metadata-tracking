Geologic studies include both near-surface deposits and bedrock. Ground water studies include flow systems, aquifer capacity, and ground water chemistry. In some areas sand and gravel deposits, sinkholes, or other features are studied. Interpretation of sensitivity to pollution is also part of an atlas. The information is organized, analyzed, and displayed using geographic information technology.

Most Geologic Atlas and Regional Hydrogeologic Assessment projects are done in two parts. The Minnesota Geological Survey covers basic geology and creates databases of information such as wells and soil borings in part A. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) handles hydrogeology and ground water sensitivity layers in Part B. Completion of a project's two parts is staggered: Part A is completed about two years before Part B, compiling information used to create part B. Parts A and B are published and distributed as two separate products.</abstract><purpose>County Geologic Atlas and Regional Hydrogeologic Assessment information is used in planning and environmental protection efforts at all levels of government. Wellhead protection and well-sealing programs are examples of local programs that need geologic and ground water information. The information is also used by businesses and the general public.</purpose><supplinf>Sibley County, Minnesota</supplinf></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>2011</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><current>See metadata for individual GIS layers located in c24_cd.zip (Supplementary Files)</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>None Planned</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-94.63</westbc><eastbc>-93.76</eastbc><northbc>44.73</northbc><southbc>44.44</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt><themekey>geoscientificInformation, Bedrock Geology, Surficial Geology, Bedrock Topography, Depth to Bedrock, Sand Distribution Model</themekey></theme><place><placekey>Minnesota, MN, Sibley County</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>Credit should be given to the Minnesota Geological Survey for any use of the given digital data in any publication.</useconst><browse><browsed>PDF file of atlas plate 4 - quaternary stratigraphy</browsed></browse><native>Arc/INFO</native><crossref><citeinfo><title>C-24, Part A.

Drillers send water well logs to the Minnesota Geological Survey, where they are reviewed, interpreted, and entered into the County Well Index (CWI), an interactive data base of water-well information. Building on the previous data, field studies are conducted to improve the understanding of local geologic and hydrologic conditions. Linework is created based upon the field studies and base data, and digitized. Background GIS data layers such as roads, surface hydrography, township grids, etc., are obtained from various sources.
