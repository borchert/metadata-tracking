DATA SOURCE
The Metropolitan Council Office of Local Assistance gets data from each county listing parcels enrolled in the Agricultural Preserves program. The Metropolitan Council then creates a shape file showing the parcels involved in the program. Users may relate the tabular data recieved from each county to this metro-wide agricultural preserve parcels layer.

DATA PROCESSING STEPS
In response to the Council request for a list of parcels enrolled in the Agricultural Preserves program, each county sent a list either as a Word document, Excel Spreadsheet or ESRI Shapefile.  We received files from all but Ramsey County, which has no parcels enrolled in the agricultural preserves program.  Each list was moved in to a DBF table and joined to the current (1/1/2008) county parcel database, then matching parcels were exported to a new shape file for each county.  All attributes except for PIN were stripped from the new shapefile and the 6 shape files were APPENDed together using the Geoprocessing Wizard from ArcToolBox.  

We received 2712 PINS listed as enrolled in the agricultural preserves program, 2690 matched (99.2% match) and 22 PINS did not match (2 in Anoka Co., 1 in Carver Co., 6  in Dakota County, 4 in Hennepin, 4 in Scott County and 5 in Washington).  This shape file can be joined with each of the agricultural preserve DBF tables with the original data provided by each of the counties.  Anoka County = 54 parcels, Carver County = 1135 parcels, Dakota County = 967 parcels, Hennepin County = 222 parcels, Scott County = 111 parcels, and Washington County = 217 parcels.


ABOUT THE PROGRAM
Before land can be enrolled in the Agricultural Preserves Program, it must meet certification for enrollment eligibility. The local unit of government must adopt a comprehensive plan that designates long-term agricultural land and establishes zoning for those areas at a density of no more than one dwelling unit per forty acres. If all requirements are met, the land is considered certified and eligible for enrollment into the program. The land owner may then enroll the land to receive the program's bennifits. Enrolled lands will have a restrictive covenanat recorded with the property deed. Enrollment status may be indefinite, or may have an expiration date (which must be at least 8 years after the date notice is given by the landowner). When an expiration date is reached, the enrollment status expires and the benefits terminate. At such a time, the landowner must re-enroll the land into the program to continue receiving the program's benefits. All or a portion of a Public Land Survey (PLS) quarter quarter section (forty') may be enrolled in the program but the active enrollment acreage cannot exceed the corresponding certified acreage.'</procdesc></procstep><srcinfo><srcscale></srcscale></srcinfo></lineage><complete>Entire seven county geographic area is covered.</complete></dataqual><spdoinfo><direct>Vector</direct><indspref>PIN number</indspref><mgmg3obj>Polygon</mgmg3obj><mgmg3til></mgmg3til></spdoinfo><eainfo><overview><eaover>PIN:   Unique regional parcel ID comprised of the county PIN with the county
