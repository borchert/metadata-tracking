      <abstract>Conservation easements are a critical component of the state&#8217;s efforts to improve water quality by reducing soil erosion, phosphorus and nitrogen loading, and improving wildlife habitat and flood attenuation on private lands. Easements protect the state&#8217;s water and soil resources by permanently restoring wetlands, adjacent native grassland wildlife habitat complexes and permanent riparian buffers. In cooperation with county Soil &amp; Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs), BWSR's easement programs compensate landowners for granting conservation easements and establishing native vegetation habitat on economically marginal, flood-prone, environmentally sensitive or highly erodible lands.</abstract>
      <purpose>The purpose of this spatial data layer is to depict the approximate boundaries of lands protected by State of Minnesota conservation easements. Boundaries should be considered approximate and do not necessarily represent survey grade data. The data should be used for general planning purposes only. Those wishing to know the exact boundaries of any particular parcel of land that is protected due to its inclusion in the program should contact the State&#8217;s Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR) to obtain the exact legal description of the easement. Any calculations related to the size of protected land parcels based on this data should be considered approximate as there are varying degrees of mapping accuracy contained within. </purpose>

        <procdesc>The boundaries and data in this layer are provided as-is without warranty or any representation of accuracy, timeliness, or completeness. There are no warranties, expressed or implied, as to the appropriate use of the maps and data or the fitness for a particular purpose. The boundaries do not represent a legal survey. No liability is assumed for the accuracy of the data delineated on any map, either expressed or implied.

Those wishing to know the exact boundaries of any particular parcel of land that is protected due to its inclusion in the program should contact the State&#8217;s Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR) to obtain the exact legal description of the easement. Any calculations related to the size of protected land parcels based on this data should be considered approximate as there are varying degrees of mapping accuracy contained within.

The accuracy of the boundaries in this layer varies depending on when and how the boundaries were drafted, and when the boundaries were digitized. Check the tabular data for the source of the data to determine its positional accuracy.

The BNDRY_SRC field indicates the method used, which indicates the relative accuracy of the boundary:

Scan: 1986-1998, digitized from georectified paper maps (accuracy is considered poor).
CAD: 1998-2013, digitized using AutoCAD (accuracy is considered fair).
GIS: 2013-Present, digitized using ArcGIS (accuracy is considered good).
Survey: various years, digitized using a legal survey (accuracy is considered excellent).</procdesc>
