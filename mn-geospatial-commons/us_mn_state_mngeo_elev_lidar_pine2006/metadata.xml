    <descript>
      <abstract>This dataset is a bare earth (vegetation removed) digital elevation model (DEM) of Pine County, Minnesota. The download file includes 1-meter and 3-meter DEMs, a 3-meter hillshade, 2-foot contours, slope and validation points. The data is FEMA-compliant.

LiDAR data for Pine County, Minnesota, was collected under contract by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. Thus, the data format is not entirely consistent with some of the other LiDAR data collected by the State of Minnesota. Specifically, the Pine County collect did not require classification of anything other than Bare Earth in the LiDAR LAS files, so there is no information on buildings, vegetation, or model key points. There are also no edge-of-water breaklines so the DEMs have not been hydro flattened.

Note: This metadata record was created at the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office by combining information from Sanborn Mapping, NRCS, and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.</abstract>
      <purpose>The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service contracted for this data to aid the soil survey with contours, hillshades, and other derivatives from the DEMs. 

This data will also be used to generate contours for use in hydraulic / hydrologic model development and for assessing environmental impacts.</purpose>

    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>This program requires LIDAR to be collected on average of 3-meter point spacing or better. Because of weather conditions, Sanborn was forced to fly the mission at a height that provided for lower mean point spacing than required by the contract.

The NAD83 datum was used. No further information on the datum was provided to DNR or MnGeo.</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>The NAVD88 vertical datum was used. No geoid information was provided to DNR or MnGeo.

The contract specifications for this data required a 'Fundamental Accuracy' (only points on open, level ground) of 18 centimeters, and 37 centimeters or better at the 95% confidence level for 4-foot contours.

With funding provided by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Houston Engineering collected 100 check points in Pine County and found the RMSEz of the Bare Earth Points to be 18.1 centimeters for consolidated accuracy across five cover classes.

        <procdesc>No documentation of sources or vendor processing steps was provided to The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) or MnGeo.

DNR Processing Steps:

1) LAS files were retiled into the state tile scheme (1/16 of a USGS 1:24,000 scale quadrangle)
2) Breakline features were merged together into a single feature class
3) Breakline features were projected from County Coordinates to UTM Zone 15, NAD83
4) Breakline Z Values were scaled from feet to meters
5) LAS Bare Earth Points and breaklines were used to create a Terrain data type 
6) 1-meter DEM was derived from Terrain using nearest neighbor interpolation option (DEM01)
7) Hillshade was derived from 1-meter DEM (DEM01HS)
8) 3-meter DEM was derived from Terrain using nearest neighbor interpolation option (DEM03)
9) Hillshade was derived from 3-meter DEM (DEM03HS)
10) Aspect was derived from 3-meter DEM (DEM03ASPECT)
11) Slope in degrees was derived from 3-meter DEM (DEM03SLOPE_DEGREES)
12) Slope in percent was derived from 3-meter DEM (DEM03SLOPE_PERCENT)
13) DEM03 was smoothed using a 3x3 mean smoothing filter 
14) 2-foot contours were created from the smoothed 3-meter DEM

No edge-of-water breaklines were collected and therefore there was no hydrologic manipulation of the terrain, DEMs or contours.

All processing was done using ArcGIS V10 and LP360 Extensions.

Funding to collect the LiDAR data and create the DEM was provided by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The Army Corps of Engineers managed the agreements and contracts. The validation process was funded by the DNR.</procdesc>

Use the tile_index.pdf maps to locate the tiles you need. Except for the county file, tiles will not be mosaicked.

a. From the county folder: ftp://ftp.lmic.state.mn.us/pub/data/elevation/lidar/county/pine/
The county mosaic is named elevation_data.gdb.zip For details of its contents and size, see this table: http://geoint.lmic.state.mn.us/lidar.php

b. In the 250k tiles folder: ftp.lmic.state.mn.us/pub/data/elevation/lidar/q250k/
