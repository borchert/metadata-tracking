Thus, the data format is not entirely consistent with some of the other LiDAR data collected by the State of Minnesota. Specifically, the Crow Wing County collect required classification of only Bare Earth in the LiDAR LAS files, so there is no information on buildings, vegetation, or model key points.

Breaklines captured as part of this effort are also a bit different. In Crow Wing County the breaklines are 3D Polyline features rather than 3D Polygon features. They also include road centerlines, stream courses and other features that are not part of the Statewide collect specifications. However, the breaklines do not have z-values associated with them so the DEMs have not been hydro-flattened.

Note: This metadata record was created at the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office by combining information supplied by Merrick &amp; Company, Crow Wing County, and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. </abstract><purpose>To produce high-resolution elevation and contour data for the county.</purpose></descript><accconst>None</accconst><crossref><citeinfo><title>For more information about elevation data for Minnesota, see: http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/chouse/elevation/index.html

LIDAR data was collected using Merrick's ALS40 sensor. The data was field-verified for complete coverage of the project area. Raw data files were parsed into manageable client-specific tiles. These tiles were then processed through automated filtering that separated the data into different classification groups: error points, ground points, and canopy-building points. The data was next taken into a graphic environment to reclassify the erroneous points that may remain in the LIDAR point cloud after auto filter. The surface was then normalized into a digital surface model (DSM). Final data extraction for the client's keypoint (statistically significant points) and canopy-building files were then generated. Using orthophotography, planimetric features were compiled as breaklines to supplement the LIDAR data. The LIDAR digital surface model was then processed with the breaklines, and contour lines were interpolated. The contours were exported from Merrick's MARS software into ESRI shape files. The contour data was checked for spikes and holes, and then imported into Arc/Info coverages for building topology, coding contour types, and creating annotation. The coverage was exported to an ESRI shapefile for delivery.

Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Processing Steps:

This acquisition of this data was coordinated by staff at Crow Wing County. The data has been projected from Crow Wing county coordinates to UTM Zone 15, NAD83 Datum and the elevation units have been scaled from feet to meters. The LAS files were then retiled to the 1/16 of a USGS 1:24,000 scale quadrangle. All of this work was done using LP360 tools.
The points in the LAS files were then sorted on GPS_TIME to put points collected next to each other in time (and thus space) close to each other in the file to speed access and increase compression efficiency. The files were then assigned a UTM Zone 15, NAD83 projection header and compressed to LAZ format using LASZIP.
The LAS files found here deviate from the State Standard when it comes to classification. What you will find are bare earth points and other points. While all points are there, those that are not bare earth are not classified. The two classes that exist are 1 - Unclassified and 2 - Ground.

DEM data provided by Crow Wing County was not hydrologically conditioned or hydro flattened even though breaklines were provided. So, the DEMs were recreated using the following technique
a) Created a terrain feature dataset 
b) Added bare earth points and breaklines to the terrain feature dataset
c) Established pyramid levels
d) Build Terrain
e) Exported a 1-meter DEM from the Terrain
f) Created a hillshade from the 1-meter DEM
g) Created a 3-meter DEM from the one meter DEM
h) Created a 3-meter hillshade

Summary of procedures:

1) LAS files were projected from County Coordinates to UTM Zone 15, NAD83
2) LAS point Z values were scaled from feet to meters
3) LAS files were retiled into the state tile scheme (1/16 of a USGS 1:24,000 scale quadrangle)
4) Breakline features were merged together into a single feature class
5) Breakline features were projected from County Coordinates to UTM Zone 15, NAD83
6) Breakline Z Values were scaled from feet to meters
7) LAS Bare Earth Points and breaklines were used to create a Terrain data type 
8) 1-meter DEM was derived from Terrain using nearest neighbor interpolation option (DEM01)
9) Hillshade was derived from 1-meter DEM (DEM01HS)
10) 3-meter DEM was derived from Terrain using nearest neighbor interpolation option (DEM03)
11) Hillshade was derived from 3-meter DEM (DEM03HS)
12) Aspect was derived from 3-meter DEM (DEM03ASPECT)
13) Slope in degrees was derived from 3-meter DEM (DEM03SLOPE_DEGREES)
14) Slope in percent was derived from 3-meter DEM (DEM03SLOPE_PERCENT)
15) DEM03 was smoothed using a 3x3 mean smoothing filter 
16) 2-foot contours were created from the smoothed 3-meter DEM

All processing was done using ArcGIS V10 and LP360 Extensions
