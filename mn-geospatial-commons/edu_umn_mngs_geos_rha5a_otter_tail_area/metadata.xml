Geologic studies include both near-surface deposits and bedrock.  Ground water studies include flow systems, aquifer capacity, and ground water chemistry.  In some areas sand and gravel deposits, sinkholes, or other features are studied.  Interpretation of sensitivity to pollution is also part of an atlas.  The information is organized, analyzed, and displayed using geographic information technology.

A Regional Hydrogeologic Assessment (RHA) is similar to a County Geologic Atlas in that both geology and ground water are studied.  However, a Regional Hydrogeologic Assessment covers a larger area, typically four to nine counties, in less detail.  The  RHA emphasizes near-surface geologic, ground water, and pollution sensitivity mapping.</abstract><purpose>County Geologic Atlas and Regional Hydrogeologic Assessment information is used in planning and environmental protection efforts at all levels of government.  Wellhead protection and well-sealing programs are examples of local programs that need geologic and ground water information. The information is also used by businesses and the general public.</purpose><supplinf>Otter Tail Area, West-Central Minnesota</supplinf></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>1999</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><current>Duration of Study, approx. 1998-1999; published in 1999.

Drillers send water well logs to the Minnesota Geological Survey, where they are reviewed, interpreted, and entered into the County Well Index (CWI), an interactive data base of water-well information.  Building on the previous data, field studies are conducted to improve the understanding of local geologic and hydrologic conditions. Linework is created based upon the field studies and base data, and digitized.  Background GIS data layers such as roads, surface hydrography, township grids, etc., are obtained from various sources, as noted in the Entity/Attribute section.
