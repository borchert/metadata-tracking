      <abstract>Estimated mean annual potential groundwater recharge rates in Minnesota from 1996-2010 based on the Soil-Water-Balance (SWB) model.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data represent mean annual potential recharge rates from 1996-2010 to surficial materials for Minnesota using the Soil-Water-Balance model (Westenbroek and others, 2010). They can be used wherever regional estimates of recharge are needed, for example, preliminary estimates for watershed planners and groundwater modelers to obtain potential recharge estimates for an area of interest. 

The methodology is documented in: Smith, E.A., and Westenbroek, S.M., 2015, Potential groundwater recharge for the state of Minnesota using the Soil-Water-Balance model, 1996-2010: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2015-5038 (project report). The original SWB model is documented in: Westenbroek, S.M., Kelson, V.A., Dripps, W.R., Hunt, R.J., and Bradbury, K.R., 2010, SWB - A modified Thornthwaite-Mather Soil-Water-Balance code for estimating groundwater recharge: U.S. Geological Survey Techniques and Methods, book 6, chap.

        <procdesc>The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, used the Soil-Water-Balance model to calculate gridded estimates of potential groundwater recharge across Minnesota for 1996-2010 at a 1-kilometer (0.621-mile) resolution. The potential groundwater recharge estimates calculated for Minnesota from the Soil-Water Balance model included gridded values (1-kilometer resolution) of annual mean estimates (that is, the means for individual years from 1996 through 2010) and mean annual estimates (that is, the mean for the 15-year period 1996-2010). The Soil-Water-Balance model uses a modified Thornthwaite-Mather soil-water-balance approach, with components of the soil-water balance calculated on a daily basis. A key advantage of this approach includes the use of commonly available geographic information system data layers that incorporate land cover, soil properties, and daily meteorological data to produce temporally and spatially variable gridded estimates of potential recharge. The Soil-Water-Balance model was calibrated by using a combination of parameter estimation techniques, making manual adjustments of model parameters, and using parameter values from previously published Soil-Water-Balance models. Each calibration simulation compared the potential recharge estimate from the model against base-flow estimates derived from three separate hydrograph separation techniques. A total of 35 Minnesota watersheds were selected for the model calibration.

Meteorological data necessary for the model included daily precipitation, minimum daily temperature, and maximum daily temperature. All of the meteorological data were provided by the Daymet dataset (Thornton and others, 2012), which included daily continuous surfaces of key climatological data. Land-cover data were provided by the 2001 and 2006 National Land Cover Database: the 2001 classification was used from 1994 through 2003, and the 2006 classification was used from 2004 through 2010. Soil data used in the model included hydrologic soils group and the available soil-water capacity. These soil data were obtained from the Natural Resources Conservation Service Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database and the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) database.

The statewide mean annual potential recharge rate from 1996-2010 was 4.9 inches per year. Potential recharge estimates increased from west to east across Minnesota. The mean annual potential recharge estimates across Minnesota at a 1-km resolution for the overall simulation period (1996-2010) ranged from less than 0.1 to 17.8 inches per year. Some of the lowest potential recharge rates for the simulation period were in the Red River of the North Basin of northwestern Minnesota, and generally were between 1.0 and 1.5 inches per year. The highest potential recharge rates were in northeastern Minnesota and the Anoka Sand Plain in central Minnesota. Eighty-eight percent of the potential recharge rates (by grid cell) were between 2 and 8 inches per year from 1996-2010. Only about 3 percent of all the potential recharge estimates (by grid cell) were less than 2 inches per year, and 9 percent of estimates were greater than 8 inches per year.

The methodology is documented in: Smith, E.A., and Westenbroek, S.M., 2015, Potential groundwater recharge for the state of Minnesota using the Soil-Water-Balance model, 1996-2010: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2015-5038, 85 p.,http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/sir20155038
