      <abstract>The Transit Routes layer contains all fixed routes serving the Twin Cities regional metropolitan area.  One shape and one corresponding record exists for each individual transit route.  

The line work for the dataset was derived from The NCompass Technologies Street Centerline and Address Range dataset.  A small number of line segments have been added to those available from the NCompass Technologies dataset to completely depict all routes traveled by fixed-route transit vehicles.

      <purpose>To identify all locations in the Twin Cities metropolitan area where fixed-route transit routes exist.</purpose>

    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Positional accuracy varies throughout the dataset.  Most line work in most counties falls within the road right of way, often near the center.  Recent realignments by the NCompass Street Centerline database have resulted in increased positional accuracy.

Text below taken from the former NCompass Technologies Street Centerline and Address Ranges metadata:

There are differing degrees of positional accuracy throughout the file. NCompass Technologies adjusts the positional accuracy of the data to available sources known to have a greater degrees of accuracy then those used to generate the existing data. However, in all cases (including instances where COGO line work has been the reference) NCompass Technologies generalizes the street segments to at least 4 feet in order to greatly reduce the number of vertices - thus reducing unnecessary file size and allowing for faster analysis. 

The goal of NCompass Technologies is to have 95% of roads located to within the approximate center of digital right-of-way data or pavement centerlines provided from counties, where such digital data is available. In other areas, 95% of roads are intended to be within ten meters of the road or right-of-way center.

    <overview>
      <eaover>LINE ATTRIBUTES:
 
route:       A number identifying the route number associated with the route and 
             its schedules.

routesort:   A numeric field identifying the route number associated with the
             route and its schedules

Routedescription (routedscrp): A brief description of the route.

routetype:     A description of the type of route.  
     
             1 - Routes that provide a connecting link between urban
               local routes, and many times serve as suburban circulators.
             2 - Routes that are radial, crosstown and limited stop 
               services which primarily operate in the center cities.
             3 - Routes that provide peak and all-day service traveling 
               non-stop on highways for four or more miles.
RouteOperator (route_oper): A description of the operator of the route.  'M' values represent
               routes are operated by Metro Transit. 'P' values represent routes not
               operated by Metro Transit.  'MP' values represent routes operated by
               Metro Transit and another transit provider.

EffectiveDate (effectived): The pick date

payleavedirectionid (payleavedi):  The direction of a route where customers are required to pay when exiting the bus rather than boarding.

routepayleave (routepayle): Routes where customers pay fare when exiting the bus rather than boarding

twelvecolor (twelvecolo): An internal code used for cartographic dispalay

*_ftrip: The first trip time served by route at the the routes first stop per service period (Weekday, Saturday, Sunday)

*_ltrip: The last trip time served by route at the routes last stop per service period (Weekday, Saturday, Sunday)

*_span: The span of service by route in hours and mintues</eaover>
