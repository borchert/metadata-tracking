      <abstract>This spreadsheet includes Minnesota Income Tax information for the years 2003-2008.  Data includes number of tax returns and the median, mean and sum of Minnesota Taxable Income (MTI).

Data are unduplicated and reported in one of four general categories:

1. Records outside of Minnesota are reported at the state level and include territories, APO's, foreign and unassigned.

Within Minnesota, records are assigned to one of three geographic levels (blockgroup, city or county):

2. Within the 7-county Twin Cities metro area, records are assigned to blockgroups.
3. Outside of the 7-county Twin Cities metro area, records are assigned to cities with populations greater than 2,000 residents.
4. All other unassigned Minnesota records are tabulated by county.

      <current>This data is current to the 2008 tax year, for taxes filed in 2009. Further updates are on hold due to a problem caused by a change in census block group boundaries in 2010. The change could make it possible to reverse engineer the data by splitting some of the old and new block groups in order to get more precise tax numbers as they pertain to a particular business; a way needs to be found to prevent this possible data disclosure.</current>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Attributes are deemed accurate but not error free.

Records are assigned to the respective geographic area through geocoding of the listed address on the filed tax return, thus introducing an unknown, presumably small, level of error to the data through incorrect addressing. Furthermore, income information is taken directly from tax return scanners, and those income figures are not verified as free of error.

It must also be noted that this dataset ONLY covers information gathered from filed, form M1 tax returns. It does not include nor factor into the aggregated figures any information about people who did not file Minnesota income taxes. Please visit the Income Tax page on the Minnesota Department of Revenue's website for additional information on filing requirements and guidelines:  http://www.revenue.state.mn.us/individuals/individ_income/Pages/File-and-Pay.aspx

IMPORTANT: The 7 records listed for the 7 Twin Cities metro counties are each the total of unmatched tax returns for those counties and are NOT the aggregate for each county. The counties are: Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington.

Geographic areas with fewer than 100 tax returns have been suppressed to ensure compliance with privacy laws.</attraccr>

    <complete>The entire state of Minnesota is included.

Data are unduplicated and reported in one of four general categories:

1. Records outside of Minnesota are reported at the state level and include territories, APO's, foreign and unassigned.

Within Minnesota, records are assigned to one of three geographic levels (blockgroup, city or county):

2. Within the 7-county Twin Cities metro area, records are assigned to blockgroups.
3. Outside of the 7-county Twin Cities metro area, records are assigned to cities with populations greater than 2,000 residents.
4. All other unassigned Minnesota records are tabulated by county.

        <procdesc>Addresses, taken from the form M-1 Minnesota Individual Income Tax Return, are geocoded using a variety of software packages, including MapMarker (MapInfo), EDQ (FirstLogic), and ZP4 (Semaphore).  Problematic addresses, such as those on a boundary of two geographic areas, are manually assigned to a geographic area by Minnesota Department of Revenue staff.  

The total number of returns for each geographic area are then used to compute the mean, median and sum of the Minnesota Taxable Income (MTI).  For additional information on how MTI is computed, please visit http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/taxterms.pdf

Data from geographic areas with fewer than 100 filed returns is then suppressed to comply with privacy laws.</procdesc>

FIPCTY -- FIPS code for each county (3-digit, text format)

FIPSTCTY -- Concatenated FIPS codes for state and county (5-digit, text format)

FIPMCD -- FIPS codes for minor civil divisions (cities); if a city is located in more than one county, the portion of the city located in each county is a separate record with a different code (5-digit, text format)

FIPTRT -- FIPS code for each Census tract (6-digit, text format)

FIPBGR -- Single-digit indicating the Census block group within a given Census tract. A block group is a cluster of census blocks having the same first digit of their four-digit identifying numbers within a census tract. For example, block group 3 within a census tract includes all blocks numbered from 3000 to 3999. (Single-digit, text format)

[IMPORTANT: For the attributes below, the 7 records listed for the 7 Twin Cities metro counties are each the total of unmatched tax returns for those counties and are NOT the aggregate for each county. The counties are: Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington.]

Returns&lt;year&gt; -- Number of tax returns in that year, for example 'RETURNS2003' is the number of tax returns for 2003.

MTI Median&lt;year&gt; -- Median Minnesota Taxable Income in that year.
