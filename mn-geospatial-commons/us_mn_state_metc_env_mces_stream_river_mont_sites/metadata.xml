Many of the sites are inactive but historic data is still available on the Council's Environmental Information Management System (EIMS).

River sites are monitored to measure MCES wastewater treatment facility compliance with NPDES requirements and state water quality standards, as well as to document trends and changes in water quality.

Stream sites are monitored to assess non-point source pollution impacts on the Metropolitan Area and measure progress towards achieving polluant reductions and improving water quality.</abstract><purpose>To show the location of monitoring sites for streams and rivers.</purpose><supplinf>East-central Minnesota.  Coverage is primarily centered on the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, but the coverage also includes MCES monitoring sites in the Minnesota River Watershed and sites along the Mississippi River south to Lake Pepin.</supplinf></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>Current</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><current>This dataset shows all river and stream monitoring sites in the Council's Environmental Information Management System (EIMS), and is synced with the EIMS system weekly.   </current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>Weekly</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-94.219</westbc><eastbc>-92.105</eastbc><northbc>45.401</northbc><southbc>43.996</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>None</themekt><themekey>surface water, water quality, water monitoring, monitoring sites, stream flow monitoring, gaging stations, monitoring points, rivers, water resources</themekey></theme><place><placekey>Minnesota, Twin Cities, Lake Pepin, Mississippi River, Minnesota River, St. Croix River, Anoka County, Carver County, Dakota County, Hennepin County, Ramsey County, Scott County, Washington County</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>None</useconst><native>ArcView Version 9x</native><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntperp><cntorg>Metropolitan Council</cntorg><cntper>Emily Resseger</cntper></cntperp><cntpos>Principal Environmental Scientist</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical</addrtype><address>390 Robert Street North</address><city>St. Paul</city><state>MN</state><postal>55101-1805</postal></cntaddr><cntvoice>651.602.1033</cntvoice><cntemail>emily.resseger@metc.state.mn.us</cntemail></cntinfo></ptcontac></idinfo><dataqual><logic>The dataset is topologically 'clean'.</logic><complete>This dataset shows all river and stream monitoring sites included in the Council's Environmental Information Management System (EIMS).

STATE: The two letter abbreviation for the state within which the monitoring site is located.

COUNTY:The name of the county within which the monitoring site is located.

CITY:The name of the city or township within which the monitoring site is located.

X_COORDINATE: X coordinate of the monitoring site (east-west axis) using UTM meters, Zone 15, NAD83.

Y_COORDINATE: Y coordinate of the monitoiring site (north-south axis) using UTM meters, Zone 15, NAD83.

MAJOR_WATERSHED: The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) major watershed within which the site is located.

SECONDARY_WATERSHED: The Metropolitan Council Environmental Services (MCES) secondary watershed within which the site is located. 

SEWERSHED: The name of the sewershed (the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP)) with which the site is associated.

SITE_NAME:  The name of the sampling location.
 
SITE_DESCR: A longer description of the sampling location.

SITE_CODE: A short code identifying a particular river or stream.  A concatenation of River_Code and Mile.

SITE_TYPE: The type or category of monitoring site.  All are categorized as Surface Water.
 
SITE_SUBTYPE: The subtype or category of monitoring site (e.g. river or stream). This is determined from monitoring program.  Only the mainstem rivers (Minnesota, Mississippi, and St. Croix) are coded as rivers all other tributaries are coded as stream. 

 RIVER_STREAM:  The name of the river or stream that contains the monitoring site.
    
MILE: The river mile recorded to the tenth of a mile that is closest to the monitoring point. River miles are measured starting at the mouth of the river.  The US Army Corp river mile system is used for the mainstem rivers.  For tributaries, river mile is measured from USGS 1:24K quad maps.

HUC_8: USGS Hydrologic Unit Code Subbasin number

HUC_10: USGS Hydrologic Unit Code Watershed number
