The collection of 1,417 paper volumes totals 304,370 pages and is housed at the Minnesota Historical Society (MHS).

The field notes serve as the fundamental legal records for real estate in Minnesota; all property titles and descriptions stem from them. They remain an essential resource for surveyors and provide a record of the state's physical geography prior to European settlement. They also serve as a testimony to many years of hard work by the surveying community, often under very challenging conditions.

The deteriorating physical condition of the volumes and the need to provide wider public access to the notes have made handling the original volumes increasingly impractical. To meet this challenge, the Office of the Secretary of State, the State Archives of the Minnesota Historical Society, the Minnesota Department of Transportation, the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office, the Minnesota Association of County Surveyors and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management collaborated in a digitization and indexing project which produced high quality (approximately 600 dpi), 24-bit color images of the maps in TIFF and JPEG 2000 formats - over 13 terabytes of data. Funding was provided by a Minnesota Historical and Cultural Heritage grant from the Minnesota Historical Society.</abstract><purpose>Minnesota's Public Land Survey field notes were converted to digital imagery to protect the original volumes from further deterioration and to provide greater public access to the notes.</purpose><supplinf>Minnesota</supplinf></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>1847</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><current>The original field note volumes were created from 1847 through 1911.</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>Unknown</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-97.5</westbc><eastbc>-89.0</eastbc><northbc>49.5</northbc><southbc>43.0</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt><themekey>planningCadastre, original survey maps, GLO maps, plat maps, Public Land Survey, PLS, Public Land Survey System, PLSS, cultural features, General Land Office, GLO, field notes, GLO field notes</themekey></theme><place><placekey>Minnesota, MN</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>In obtaining this data from MnGeo, it is understood that you and/or your organization have the right to use it for any purpose.

The Minnesota Historical Society (MHS) awarded a Minnesota Historical and Cultural Heritage grant to the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office (MnGeo) to scan, index and distribute Minnesota's field note volumes archived at MHS. MnGeo worked in partnership with MHS, the Office of the Secretary of State (SOS), Minnesota Department of Transportation, Minnesota Association of County Surveyors and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM).

Project Timeline: February 2010 - June 30, 2011

- Grant awarded in February 2010.
- MHS / MnGeo contracts executed.
- MnGeo created an advisory committee to help guide the project.
- MnGeo prepared and published a Request for Proposal (RFP) for scanning the field notes.
- Scanning contract was awarded to Perfect Image of Kirkland, WA.
- Perfect Image began scanning field notes on-site at MHS in December 2010.
- Cadastral Survey System (CSS) software developed for BLM by Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) was modified and used by MnGeo staff to index (link) the field note pages to corresponding township survey information and original survey plats.
- BLM trained MnGeo staff to use CSS.
- MnGeo staff began indexing field notes in January 2011.
- MHS scanned over-sized field note volume insets included in the collection and delivered to MnGeo.
- Perfect Image completed scanning (nearly 304,000 pages) in early May 2011.
- MnGeo staff completed indexing and quality assurance testing in late June 2011.
- All images and CSS database shipped to BLM in mid-August 2011. They will maintain an archival copy of the information and provide public access.
- BLM will make Minnesota's field notes and plats available via their website in 2012.

STEP 1:  PROJECT MANAGEMENT 

An advisory committee with representatives from federal, state, county, tribal, education and private sectors, provided expertise and assistance with the RFP, quality assurance / quality control (QA/QC) of the scanned pages, support and product review.

MnGeo's Main Tasks:
- Create an advisory committee to help guide the project.
- Prepare and publish an RFP for scanning the field notes.
- Scanning contract was awarded to Perfect Image of Kirkland, WA.
- Create an agreement with SAIC to modify the Cadastral Survey System (CSS) indexing software to accommodate Minnesota's M page numbers. (M numbers are page numbers assigned by SOS. One M-number is assigned to both a right and a left page.)
- Convert Minnesota GLO maps from TIFF to MrSID formats. TIFF format is used for archival purposes; MrSID and JPG are formats for web display and delivery products.
- Geo-reference original survey plats digitized by MnGeo (formerly LMIC) in 2004.
- Establish QA/QC procedures and a venue for dealing with exceptions.
- Send MnDOT survey technicians and lead project survey to BLM for CSS training.
- Monitor scanning progress and image quality.
- Modify contract with Perfect Image to accommodate an increase in the number of pages to be scanned as well as for increased time to adjust scanning process to better capture surveyor notes that ran into a volume's gutter (the area beyond the normal page margin that is close to the volume binding).
- Perform final quality assurance testing of images and indexing.
- Ship copies of images to MHS for archiving.
- Prepare final report and financial statements.
- Ship final images and CSS database to BLM.
- Complete metadata for field notes.


STEP 2:  SCANNING 

In early 2010, MHS awarded a Minnesota Historical and Cultural Heritage grant to MnGeo to scan and index the field note images using BLM's CSS software. Through a competitive bid process, MnGeo awarded the scanning contract to:

Perfect Image
13615 126th Place Suite 450
Kirkland, WA 98034
425-576-0989

Perfect Image performed all scanning on-site at MHS. Project manager: Sean Chambers. Principal scanning operator: John Dopp. All work was overseen by Eric Fleming, owner of Perfect Image.

From December 2010 - June 2011, Perfect Image scanned 1,417 field note volumes (304,370 images) using the following equipment and specifications:

Scanners:
Two Atiz DIY Model B, each with a V-Shaped auto-centering cradle and glass platen
2 Canon Single Lens Reflex (SLR) Cameras - one for each page

Scanner settings:  Camera settings were adjusted often due to a significant variability in the type and color both of the paper and the writing instrument.

Cropping: Automatic page detection was used. The cropped area was then padded 0.375 inches to ensure that the entire page is visible.

Resolution: 
- 644 dpi horizontal (optical) x 644 dpi vertical (optical) - Typical
- Resolution ranges from 544 to 644 depending on physical dimensions and processing.
- Valid resolutions: 544, 567, 600, 604 and 644

Color Output: Scanned at 24-bit Red-Green-Blue (RGB)

Issues:
- Writing into the gutters (the area beyond the normal page margin that is close to the volume binding): The issue was minimized by shifting the glass platen slightly left or right to reduce the distortion at the 'V' of the platen. This also captured all the writing visible before the binding.
- Faint or faded pages: Readability was increased by using various camera settings and post-processing before creating the JPEG 2000 file.
- Very large volume of images and individual file size of the products:  A (up to) 24 TeraByte (TB) external storage device -- http://www.drobo.com -- was used to process and store the images.


Product #1: TIFF images 

File Processing:
- Camera images are JPEG with lossless compression.
- Start with camera images, with camera settings, and then crop the image.
- Each camera image was checked by Perfect Image staff.
- Each image was converted to TIFF format.

File Transfer: Transferred to MnGeo on 2 TB USB hard drives along with JP2 images.


Product #2: JPEG 2000 (JP2) images 

File Processing:
- Field note image was processed to enhance readability.
- Software - BatchPhoto
- Convert to JPEG 2000 Settings:  Lossless, quality layers: 25, JP2, tiles: 1024 x 1024

File Transfer: Transferred to MnGeo on 2 TB USB hard drives.


STEP 3:  OVER-SIZED FIELD NOTE INSETS

In many volumes, large format 'inset' maps and diagrams existed. These over-sized images were scanned by MHS.


Product #1: TIFF

Scanned at MHS by MHS staff:  Nick Duncan or Matthew Goff

Total number of images:  328

Every image was checked by MHS and MnGeo staff

Scanner capabilities:
1. Tabloid size or smaller - Epson 1000XL (flat bed scanner)
Optical Resolution: 2400 dpi
Color: 48-bit
Maximum Scan Area: 12.2 x 17.2

2. Larger than tabloid size - Contex HD3630 (roll feed scanner)
Optical Resolution: 600 dpi
Color: 48-bit
Maximum Scan Area: 36 inches wide

Scanning:
Resolution: 600 dpi horizontal (optical) x 600 dpi vertical (optical)
Color: 24-bit

Software:
1. Tabloid size or smaller - Photoshop PS5 Pro
2. Larger than tabloid size - NextImage

File Processing (TIFF):
- Deskew
- Crop
- Some images scanned in two pieces
- One image was sent to MHS conservation team for repair before scanning

File Transfer (TIFF): Saved to USB Flash Drive


Product #2: JPEG 2000 (JP2) 

MnGeo's staff created these using Acrobat 7.1

Software: Adobe Acrobat Professional 7
Save As JPEG2000, Quality: Lossless, Tile Size: 256

The TIFF and JP2 images were placed on a network drive accessible to CSS. Then CSS was used to swap out placeholder images with the correct images.


STEP 4:  INDEXING

Indexing Software: Cadastral Survey System (CSS) developed for BLM by Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). Features of the software include importing images into the system and assigning each record a unique ID (DM ID).

Image QA/QC was done by MnGeo staff while performing the following indexing tasks:
- Link each field note page to its corresponding plat map image and database
- Assign page / M-page numbers
- Check page type: Body, Intro, Cert., Title, Vol. Indx., Inx. Diag., Gen Desc., Fld. Ast.
- Add survey information: date, surveyor, which boundary, etc.
- Fill in appropriate township(s) and range(s)

File Storage:
- At MnGeo and MHS: Drobo (a RAID 5 expandable storage device which uses a combination of 3.5-inch SATA drives)
- Final data, over 13 TB, was shipped to BLM on a Drobo. BLM will import and archive all the data and make the information available to the public.</procdesc></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><indspref></indspref><direct></direct><mgmg3obj></mgmg3obj><mgmg3til>Public Land Survey Township</mgmg3til></spdoinfo><eainfo><overview><eaover>The indexing attributes are used only to enable the search for images that meet criteria.
