      <abstract>This dataset depicts the status and source of community water supplies in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. Communities are categorized as having no public water supplies (only private wells), those who use local water sources for a public water supply system, those who use water from outside their community boundaries as a public water supply, and those who supply themselves as well as other communities. This dataset also defines the source(s) of water supplying the community as groundwater, surface water, or both.</abstract>
      <purpose>The 2005 Minnesota Legislature directed the Metropolitan Council to "carry out planning activities addressing the water supply needs of the metropolitan area" (Minnesota Statutes, Section 473.1565). Specifically the Council is charged with developing a base of technical information for water supply planning decisions and to prepare a metropolitan area master water supply plan. This dataset supports this charge.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Twin Cities Seven County Metropolitan Area. This includes the counties of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington in Minnesota.</supplinf>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>This dataset is accurate as of 2009, based on the most recent available Minnesota Department of Health Minnesota Drinking Water Information System data and information from community water supply plans. The data is relavent at the community or public water supply system scale (multiple communities may be served by a single water supply system). This dataset does not depict small portions of communities, such as individividual neighborhoods, served by suppliers beyond the community boundaries, except when defining the communities' water supply sources. For example, this dataset does not recognize Oak Grove as being served by a municipal system even though a small isolated neighborhood IS served by St. Francis. However, this dataset DOES recognize that Edina uses both groundwater and surface water, although only a small isolated community recieves surface water from MInneapolis.</attraccr>
