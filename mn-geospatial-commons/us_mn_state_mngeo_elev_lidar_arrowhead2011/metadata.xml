The data cover Carlton, Cook, Lake and St. Louis counties, part of Itasca County, and Voyageurs National Park in Koochiching County.  LiDAR data are in the UTM Zone 15 coordinate system, NAD83 96 NAVD88 Geoid09, meters. The tiling scheme is 16th USGS 1:24,000 quadrangle tiles.

The vendor delivered the data to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) in several formats:

1) One-meter digital elevation model
2) Edge-of-water breaklines
3) Classified LAS formatted point cloud data

DNR staff created two additional products: two-foot contours and building outlines.

Note: This metadata record was created at the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office by combining information supplied by Woolpert and DNR.</abstract><purpose>The Minnesota Elevation Mapping Project was initiated to support the development of high accuracy land surface information for the purposes of improving water quality, flood emergency preparedness and response, floodplain mapping, transportation planning and design, recreational planning and design, urban planning and to provide more efficient and effective project planning and execution.  This project was funded by the Clean Water Fund of the Clean Water, Land and Legacy Amendment with contributions from the Natural Resources Conservation Service, The National Parks Service and Lake County.

1. Report from Woolpert:  The LiDAR data vertical accuracy RMSE is 5.0 cm (0.16 ft). The data collected under this Task Order meets the National Standard for Spatial Database Accuracy (NSSDA) accuracy standards. The NSSDA standards specify that vertical accuracy be reported at the 95 percent confidence level for data tested by an independent source of higher accuracy: http://www.fgdc.gov/standards/projects/FGDC-standards-projects/accuracy/part3/index_html 

The Fundamental Vertical Accuracy (FVA) of the TIN: 9.8cm (0.31 ft) at a 95% confidence level, derived according to NSSDA, i.e., based on RMSE of 5.0 cm (0.16 ft) in the 'open terrain' land cover category.

Woolpert Inc. was selected to provide LiDAR services for CFMS Contract Number B41672 T-Number 1029G Work Order #3 - Minnesota Arrowhead Region LiDAR Acquisition.

Using Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) systems, 390 flight lines of high density data, at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 1.0 meter for acquisition areas 1 and 2 while the remaining areas were collected and processed to meet a Nominal Post Spacing (NPS) of 1.5 meter, were collected over Minnesota counties of Carlton, Cook, Lake, St. Louis, and Itasca Counties and that portion of Koochiching County that comprises Voyageurs National Park (approximately 12,433 square miles). Multiple returns were recorded for each laser pulse along with an intensity value for each return.

A total of 55 missions were flown over a 20 day period: May 03, 2011 through June 02, 2011. A minimum of two airborne global positioning system (GPS) base stations were used in support of the LiDAR data acquisition. 87 ground control points were surveyed through static methods. The geoid used to reduce satellite derived elevations to orthometric heights was Geoid09. All data for the task order is referenced to UTM 15N, NAD83, NAVD88, in meters. Airborne GPS data was differentially processed and integrated with the post processed IMU data to derive a smoothed best estimate of trajectory (SBET). The SBET was used to reduce the LiDAR slant range measurements to a raw reflective surface for each flight line. The coverage was classified to extract a bare earth digital elevation model (DEM) and separate last returns. In addition to the LAS deliverables, one layer of coverage were delivered in the ArcINFO ArcGrid binary format: bare-earth.

Breaklines defining water bodies and streams were compiled for this task order. The breaklines were used to perform the hydrologic flattening of water bodies, and gradient hydrologic flattening of double line streams.  The breaklines defining lakes, greater than two acres, and double-line linear hydrography features, wider than 30.5 meters (100 feet), were compiled using digital photogrammetric techniques as part of the hydrographic flattening process and provided as ESRI Polygon Z shape files.  Lakes, islands, reservoirs and ponds, at a nominal minimum size of two acres or greater, were compiled as closed polygons. The closed water bodies were collected at a constant elevation. Rivers and streams, at a nominal minimum width of 30.5 meters (100 feet), were compiled in the direction of flow with both sides of the stream maintaining an equal gradient elevation.  Only islands greater than two acres were captured.

One-meter DEMs were created by extracting bare earth points from the LAS data and hydro flattening using edge of water breaklines.

Formats:
- DEMs: ESRI Floating Point Raster
- Building outlines, breaklines: ESRI 3D Polygon features
- Contours: ESRI 3D Polyline features
- Mass_points: ESRI 3D multipoint features
- LAS: ASPRS V1.2

Data is tiled by 1/16 1:24,000-scale quadrangle.
Horizontal datum:  NAD83 96
Vertical datum:  NAVD88 (Geoid09)

Additional Products Generated by Minnesota DNR staff:

These products are in the geodatabase for each of the tiles:

1. Two-foot contours were created by resampling the 1-meter DEM to 3 meters, then smoothing the 3-meter grid using a neighborhood average routine, and then creating contours from this surface using standard ArcGIS processing tools.

2. Building outlines were created by extracting from the LAS files those points with Classification 6 (buildings), then grouping those points within 3 meters of each other into a single cluster and then creating an outline around those points. This was done using standard ArcMap tools.

3. Hillshades were created from the one- and three-meter DEMs using standard ArcMap tools.
