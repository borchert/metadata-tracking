The linework for this dataset comes from individual counties and is assembled by the Metropolitan Council for the MetroGIS community. 

The County CTU Lookup Table here https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/us-mn-state-metc-bdry-counties-and-ctus-lookup 
is also included in this dataset and contains various data related to cities, townships, unorganized territories (CTUs) and any divisions created by county boundaries splitting them is also included in the dataset. 

This dataset is updated quarterly. This dataset is composed of three shape files and one dbf table. 
- Counties.shp = county boundaries 
- CTUs.shp = city, township and unorganized territory boundaries 
- CountiesAndCTUs.shp = combined county and CTU boundaries
- CountyCTULookupTable.dbf = various data related to CTUs and any divisions created by county boundaries splitting them is also included in the dataset, described here: https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/us-mn-state-metc-bdry-counties-and-ctus-lookup

NOTES:

- On 3/17/2011 it was discovered that the CTU ID used for the City of Lake St. Croix Beach was incorrect.  It was changed from 2394379 to 2395599 to match GNIS.

- On 3/17/2011 it was discovered that the CTU ID used for the City of Lilydale was incorrect.  It was changed from 2394457 to 2395708 to match GNIS.

- On 11/9/2010 it was discovered that the CTU ID used for the City of Crystal was incorrect.  It was changed from 2393541 to 2393683 to match GNIS.

- Effective April 2008,  a change was made in GNIS to match the FIPS place codes to the "civil" feature for each city instead of the "populated place" feature.  Both cities and townships are now "civil" features within GNIS.  This means that the official GNIS unique ID for every city in Minnesota has changed.  

- The five digit CTU codes in this dataset are identical to the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) ''Place'' codes.  They are also used by the Census Bureau and many other organizations and are proposed as a MN state data coding standard.

- Cities and townships have also been referred to as ''MCDs'' (a census term), however this term technically refers to the part of each city or township within a single county.  Thus, a few cities in the metro area that are split by county boundaries are actually comprised of two different MCDs. This was part of the impetus for a proposed MN state data standard that uses the ''CTU'' terminology for clarity.

- The boundary line data for this dataset comes from each county.

-  A variety of civil divisions of the land exist within the United States.  In Minnesota, only three types exist - cities, townships and unorganized territories.  All three of these exist within the Twin Cities seven county area.  The only unorganized territory is Fort Snelling (a large portion of which is occupied by the MSP International Airport).

-  Some cities are split between two counties.  Only those parts of cities within the 7-county area are included.

- Prior to the 2000 census, the FIPS Place code for the City of Greenwood in Hennepin County was changed from 25928 to 25918.  This dataset reflects that change.

Anoka County
No testing of the positional accuracy has been done.

Carver County
County has GPS data for all 1/4 Section corners accurate to 1/50th foot.  Township boundaries that follow PLS lines are estimated at between 0.2 ft. and 0.5 ft. of true location. City boundaries that follow PLS lines are also expected to be near this range of accuracy. Other boundaries are within .5' to 5' of horizontal accuracy.

Dakota County
Estimated +or- 0.2 feet on lines that follow the PLS or well described parcels.  90% of lines are estimated to be within 0.5 feet of true location.  Some problem areas exist.  For example, many questions exist as to where the boundary of Mendota is supposed to be.

Hennepin County
Estimated +or- 2 to 4 feet at section corners.  Positional accuracy decreases with distance from section corners.

Ramsey County
The majority of the municipal boundary layer possesses a horizontal positional accuracy equivalent to that of our digitized parcels.  (+-7 feet) Exceptions to this include unresolved boundary issues and interpreted boundary positions such as the thread of the Mississippi River.  Some areas could deviate in position by more than 100 feet.  Further municipal boundary annexation information may be found at the Minnesota Planning agency,  the municipality in question or at the Minnesota Department of Transportation which performs most annexation mapping functions.  Public Land Survey (PLS) and parcel mapping information can be found at the Ramsey County Surveyors Office.

Scott County
Township boundaries that follow PLS lines are estimated at between 0.4 ft. and 1 ft. of true location.  City boundaries that follow PLS lines are also expected to be near this range of accuracy.  Other boundaries are thought to be within 20 or 40 ft.

Washington County
Boundaries shown that coincide with hydrological features or those that have generalized definitions with little supporting detail of their location are digitized from partially rectified aerial photographs at 1 inch equals 200 feet. These features have been tested 23 feet horizontal accuracy at the 95% confidence level using NSSDA testing procedures except in areas of high vertical relief where such features tested 120 feet horizontal accuracy by use of other testing procedures. Boundaries defined as center of main channel on Mississippi and St. Croix rivers are approximations only (source U.S.G.S. quadrangle maps). All other boundary segments are generated by coordinate geometry based on a framework of accurately located PLSS corner positions. Legal boundary definitions were interpreted and analyzed according to records available and are not based on field survey. The nature of these definitions present situations where documents of record may not coincide with known ground position or that their ambiguity makes it difficult to identify precise ground location. As a result, caution is necessary in use of the municipal boundary data when using it in site specific applications.
