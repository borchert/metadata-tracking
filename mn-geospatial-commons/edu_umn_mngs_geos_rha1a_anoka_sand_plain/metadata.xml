      <abstract>A County Geologic Atlas is a systematic study of a county's geologic and ground water resources. Geologic studies include both near-surface deposits and bedrock.  Ground water studies include flow systems, aquifer capacity, and ground water chemistry.  In some areas sand and gravel deposits, sinkholes, or other features are studied.  Interpretation of sensitivity to pollution is also part of an atlas.  The information is organized, analyzed, and displayed using geographic information technology.

A Regional Hydrogeologic Assessment (RHA) is similar to a County Geologic Atlas in that both geology and ground water are studied.  However, a Regional Hydrogeologic Assessment covers a larger area, typically four to nine counties, in less detail.  The  RHA emphasizes near-surface geologic, ground water, and pollution sensitivity mapping.</abstract>
      <purpose>County Geologic Atlas and Regional Hydrogeologic Assessment information is used in planning and environmental protection efforts at all levels of government.  Wellhead protection and well-sealing programs are examples of local programs that need geologic and ground water information. The information is also used by businesses and the general public.</purpose>

        <procdesc>Investigations begin with a review of existing information, such as earlier geologic maps, soil maps, and hydrologic reports. Drillers send water well logs to the Minnesota Geological Survey, where they are reviewed, interpreted, and entered into the County Well Index (CWI), an interactive data base of water-well information.  Building on the previous data, field studies are conducted to improve the understanding of local geologic and hydrologic conditions.

Data was originally digitized in UTM Coordinates, Zone 15, NAD27, with a y-shift of 4,700,000. In 1999 the data was converted to UTM, Zone 15, NAD83, unshifted.

There is no layer-specific metadata for this data set. </procdesc>

    <overview>
      <eaover>The Anoka Sand Plain Regional Hydrogeologic Assessment consists of 23 separate GIS data layers. Five were created by the Minnesota Geological Survey especially for this assessment; the others are background layers from various sources used as reference and for cartography.  Much of the background information is from the Bureau of the Census TIGER Line files. 

The geology work was based on creating a map series at 1:200,000. Some of the background layers consist of larger-scale data. (TIGER data is scaled at 1:100,000).  An overall scale of 1:200,000 is assigned to the dataset. 

The data is accompanied by two text files, describing Pollution Sensitivity and Surficial Geology.</eaover>
