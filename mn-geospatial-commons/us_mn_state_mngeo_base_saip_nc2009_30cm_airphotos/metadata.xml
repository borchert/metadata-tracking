<abstract>This dataset contains 4 Band, red, green, blue, infrared
(RGBI) digital orthophoto imagery of the Big Fork and Little Fork
watersheds (most of Koochiching county, northern Itasca county, the
middle portion of St. Louis county), and southeast St. Louis County
(Duluth-Superior) in northern Minnesota. The orthophotos are 0.3
meter ground sample distance (GSD) and are in UTM Zone 15, NAD83
(meters). The tiling format of the imagery is based on a 3.75' x
3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 150 meter buffer on all four sides.
The dataset includes 614 digital orthophoto quarter quadrangles
(DOQQs) in GeoTiff format with an associated world file, and this
metadata file. The data is available online as a web mapping
service (WMS). All imagery was collected by Keystone Aerial Surveys
Inc with a Vexcel UltraCamX camera from an altitude of
approximately 15,500 feet. All imagery was processed by Keystone
using the camera manufacturer's software, Inpho's photogrammetry
suite and Keystone-created software. Funding for this data was
provided by the Minnesota Natural Heritage Fund, the Minnesota
Clean Water Legacy Act, The Environmental and Natural Resources
Trust Fund, St. Louis County, the Coastal Zone Management Program,
and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency.</abstract>
<purpose>The orthophotos will be used by the Minnesota DNR to
update the National Wetland Inventory maps and as a base layer for
mapping wetlands and other business needs. Additional funding was
provided for this enhanced resolution dataset by the Minnesota
Pollution Control Agency, St. Louis County, and the U.S. Geological
Survey to support their various business needs. This type of
leaf-off photography is a critical component for a variety of land
management applications including transportation planning, wetland
mapping, urban planning, forest management, soil mapping, and
utility siting.</purpose>

<horizpar>The target accuracy standard was the American Society for
Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) standard for 1:12,000
scale maps, 95% of well-defined points fall within 24.5 feet. The
vendor's horizontal accuracy test yielded a circular root mean
square error (RMSE) of 11.0 feet. An independent horizontal
accuracy test was performed by the Minnesota DNR. The result from
the independent check yielded an RMSE of 6.6 feet with a 95%
confidence interval of 11.5 feet. This corresponds to the ASPRS
accuracy standard for 1:6000 scale maps.</horizpar>

<procdesc>Keystone Aerial Surveys Inc. acquired new vertical,
digital black and white, color, and color infrared, photography at
an altitude of 15,500 feet photo scale of 1''= 3518 (1:42216) with
a 0.3-meter GSD (ground sample distance) with Vexcel UltraCamX
cameras. Flight lines were north-south with a 60% forward overlap
and a 20% side lap. The 69 flight lines and 5394 exposures were
flown in May of 2009. Ground conditions ranged from completely
leaf-off to early leaf-on phase. The UltraCamX camera consists of
13 sensors: 9 panchromatic sensors and 4 color sensors. The color
sensors are 4810 x 3140 pixels in size, with one sensor capturing
red data, one capturing blue data, one capturing green data, and
one capturing near-infrared data (band pass 680-940nm). The 9 pan
sensors slightly overlap one to another and are used to produce one
large image, 14430 x 9420 pixels in size. The vendor's processing
software and current calibration are used to create the final image
and pan sharpen the color bands to create the final RGBI image at
the above dimensions and a pixel size of 7.2 microns. MnGeo used
the TIFF files to create the WMS (web mapping service) layer that
is available online. The digital acquisition was accompanied by the
collection of airborne Global Positioning System (GPS) data and
inertial measurement unit (IMU) data, the post processing of which
yields a strong exterior orientation (EO) for each photograph and a
very accurate center position. A fully analytical Aerotriangulation
(AT) of the aerial images was conducted using ground control, GPS
and the IMU data to further refine the EO for each image to be used
in the orthorectification process. This was accomplished with Inpho
Match-AT. The MNDNR provided the USGS 30-meter digital elevation
model (DEM) to Keystone for use in the orthorectification process.
These were loaded into visualization software to confirm their
accuracy and, where needed, were corrected and/or enhanced using
Inpho DTMaster. Digital Orthophoto Quarter-Quads were developed
following the USGS standards for digital orthophotos (DOQs) with
the exception of pixel resolution (0.3 meters) and file format
(TIFF with world files). USGS header (.hdr) files were not included
as a deliverable. Keystone used Inpho OrthoMaster to create
orthophotos, Inpho OrthoVista to seam the DOQQs and the Inpho
suite, ESRI ArcGIS and Photoshop CS3 to radiometrically balance and
seam the DOQQs. MnGeo used the TIFF files to create the WMS (web
mapping service) layer that is available online.</procdesc>
