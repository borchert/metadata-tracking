      <abstract>This dataset consists of 0.3-meter pixel resolution (approximately 1-foot), natural color orthoimages covering the Minneapolis-St. Paul urban area footprint.

An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. 

[Note: this metadata record was reformatted at the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office from the record provided by USGS - several of the fields were changed to reflect MnGeo's seamless web mapping service (WMS) data delivery]</abstract>
      <purpose>These data have been created as a result of the need for having geospatial data immediately available and easily accessible in order to enhance the capability of Federal, State, and local emergency responders, as well as plan for homeland security efforts.

      <attraccr>The digital imagery for each acquisition sortie is differentially rectified to produce orthophotography for the Red, Green, and Blue channels at a resolution of 0.3-meter per pixel. As a part of the ISTAR workflow, the data from the color channels is edge sharpened using the nadir panchromatic channel. The orthophoto mosaics are inspected for accuracy issues that fall in the following categories: Aerotriangulation related digital surface model (DSM) related Accuracy issues will be investigated through review and correction of the DSM or triangulation adjustment. Once the imagery has passed quality control review, final radiometric adjustments are performed to create a uniform overall appearance.</attraccr>

        <horizpar>Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
Compliance with the accuracy standard was ensured by the placement of photo identifiable ground control points and the collection of airborne GPS data. Using several tools that are part of the ISTAR workflow, a digital surface model (DSM) was correlated at a post spacing of 2 meter depending on terrain and land cover. The ISTAR correlation algorithm computes the X,Y,Z value for each DSM post utilizing every stereo angle that is available. A series of DSM files were created for each acquisition block, one for each stereo look angle. A mosaic was then created from the separate DSM files where the best vertical value for each posting was selected from all look angles compared against the aerotriangulation adjustment which is incorporated into the mosaic. EarthData will then edit the surface to the level required to support the orthophoto production. A root mean square (RMS) value was calculated based on the imagery utilized in the production of the tile by comparing the AT X and Y coordinates. This value represents an estimate of the accuracy of the horizontal coordinate measurements in the tile expressed in meters.

The design accuracy is estimated not to exceed 3-meter diagonal RMS error (2.12m RMSE in X or Y).

Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Value: 0.121371

Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Explanation:
The horizontal accuracy of the orthorectified images is mainly determined by the accuracy of the aerotriangulation and digital surface model (DSM). For each rectified image (lift), an RMSE value for all of the standard errors of the tie/pass/control points located in that image (lift) and computed by the aerotriangulation solution was calculated. The DSM accuracy assessment was achieved by comparing the aerotriangulation-derived elevation with the elevation of the DSM. In addition, visual examination was employed to assess all tiles and its relative edge match. All results were examined for consistency and its compliance with the NSSDA accuracy standard.</horizpar>

PROCESS DESCRIPTION

Process_Date: 07/23/2004
Source imagery: ADS40 Digital Camera Imagery.
Control: Airborne GPS/IMU supplemented with photo identifiable field control.
Aerotriangulation: ISTAR software package.
Elevation Model: ISTAR software package.
Radiometric Balancing: ISTAR software package and COTS Software (PhotoShop).
Orthorectification: ISTAR software package.
Mosaic: ISTAR software package and Z/I Imaging OrthoPro software package.

The following section describes the ISTAR digital image production sequence. This is a mature, stable workflow and incorporates all production components into an integrated series of tools to accomplish photogrammetric mensuration, aerotriangulation, elevation model development, ortho production and finishing. Production processes are fully documented in accordance with ISO9001 mandates.

The following is a step-by-step description of the ISTAR production workflow used to develop digital orthophotography to support the Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN task:

1. The unprocessed ADS40 data and accompanying GPS and IMU data for one or more sorties is downloaded from the portable hard disks and checked to verify that no files are corrupted and that all data can be downloaded.

2. The GPS/IMU (internal measure unit)  parameters for each sortie are optimized using the ground control points and the error calibration map. The horizontal and vertical positions of all ground control points in the block are observed in each channel (R,G,B, IR, S1 Pan ,S2 Pan and Nadir Pan).

3. Aerotriangulation is accomplished using the CLB tool that is a component of the ISTAR process. The ground control, GPS and IMU information is ingested and tie points between strips are identified. Normally, only three (3) tie points are needed between adjacent flight lines.

4. CLB produces a bundle adjustment for each data sortie. A digital file containing the RMSE computations of the adjustment is derived and available as a deliverable. The results of the adjustment are verified through the development of a sub-sampled panchromatic mosaic for the data sortie. The mosaic is corrected using the aerotriangulation points only. This mosaic is inspected by the photogrammetric technician to identify any gross errors in the adjustment as well as the identification of any voids or image quality problems.

5. Using several tools that are part of the ISTAR workflow, a digital surface model (DSM) is correlated at a post spacing of 2 meter depending on terrain and land cover. The ISTAR correlation algorithm computes the X,Y,Z value for each DSM post utilizing every stereo angle that is available. A series of DSM files are created for acquisition block, one for each stereo look angle. A mosaic is then created from the separate DSM files where the best vertical value for each posting is selected from all look angles compared against the aerotriangulation adjustment which is incorporated into the mosaic. EarthData will then edit the surface to the level required to support the orthophoto production.

6. The digital imagery for each acquisition sortie is differentially rectified to produce orthophotography for the Red, Green, and Blue channels at a resolution of 0.3-meter per pixel. As a part of the ISTAR workflow, the data from the color channels is edge sharpened using the nadir panchromatic channel. The orthophoto mosaics are inspected for accuracy issues that fall in the following categories: Aerotriangulation related DSM related Accuracy issues will be investigated through review and correction of the DSM or triangulation adjustment. Once the imagery has passed quality control review, final radiometric adjustments are performed to create a uniform overall appearance.

The final 1500-meter X 1500-meter tiles are clipped out and the imagery is output in GeoTIFF format. GeoTIFF files will include the following GeoTIFF tags and keys: Model Tiepoint Tag Model Pixel Scale Tag GT Model Type Geo Key GT Raster Type Geo Key Projected CST Type Geo Key PCS Citation Geo Key Proj Linear Units Geo Key

7. The completed digital orthophotos are checked for image quality. Minor artifacts will be corrected using Adobe Photoshop in an interactive editing session. Digital files are assigned final names derived from the southwest corner of each tile and are based on the U.S. National Grid (USNG).

8. The project manager is responsible for coordinating and performing quality control on the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) compliant metadata. File level metadata is provided in .xml format.
