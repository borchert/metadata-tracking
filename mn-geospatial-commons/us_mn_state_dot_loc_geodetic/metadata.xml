      <abstract>The Geodetic Database contains information on permanent geodetic control marks located in Minnesota or just outside its boundaries. Permanent geodetic control marks are established for the purpose of providing precise horizontal and vertical control positions for the registration of surveying and mapping activities in the local area. Information about the location of an object based on its geodetic location locates that object in a worldwide geographic information system. The marks have unique identification and year established stamped on the monument disk, usually an 89 mm (3.5 inch) diameter brass or aluminum disk. Monuments consist of material (concrete or metal) that is meant to stay in place for 50 to 100 years or more, and have little or no movement due to frost action or activity near the monument. The marks have been established by all levels of government in Minnesota, and they are referenced to the National Geodetic Reference System (NAD 1927, NAD 1983, NGVD 1929, and NAVD 1988). The Federal Government supports monumentation at the state level by providing technical expertise, adjustments of the data, and maintenance of the National Geodetic Reference System through its State Advisor Program.</abstract>
      <purpose>To provide geodetic control information in an electronic medium that will allow convenient data access, modification, and distribution. The data stored in the database allows the user to:

1. Create reports on all geodetic control monuments that reside in a specified area (by county, by township,  range, or section, by Latitude and Longitude, etc.)

2. Create a computer file of geodetic control mark data

3. Create a file for input in a GIS format</purpose>

    <complete>State of Minnesota is complete. However, not all control marks in the geodetic database have precise horizontal and vertical positions but nearly all have one or the other. Precise horizontal positions are displayed in three forms:

1. Latitude and Longitude on a spherical coordinate system based on NAD 27 and/or NAD 83 Datums.The NAD 83 has had two adjustments, in 1986 and 1996 and is denoted by NAD 83 (1986) and NAD 83 (1996).

2. X and Y plane coordinates on the Minnesota State Plane Coordinate System, South, Central, or North Zones, based on NAD 27 and/or NAD 83 Datums.

3. X and Y plane coordinates on the Minnesota County Coordinate System based on NAD 83 Datum only.

4. X and Y plane coordinates on the UTM Coordinate System, Zone 15

All elevations are displayed as the mark's height above mean sea level for both the NGVD 29 and the NAVD 88 Datum.</complete>

        <procdesc>HISTORY OF THE GEODETIC DATABASE:

The need for a Geodetic Database available to the local surveying and mapping community has been identified at many levels of local government. Increased uses of the Global Positioning System (GPS) for positioning objects or monuments has generated more requests for geodetic control information. Access to geodetic control information for all levels of government and the private sector fosters a common locational reference system and acceptable accuracy standards for all levels of GIS/LIS activities. The Mn/DOT Geodetic Unit recognized this need in the early Seventies, and work was started to automate the information then.

Computer formatting of this data took place in stages over the past twenty years. The new horizontal datum (NAD 83) was made available in August, 1986, and the new vertical datum (NAVD 88) became available in November, 1991. With the introduction of the new horizontal datum, Mn/DOT provided a ground coordinate system (County Coordinates) that allows the user to compute and map using horizontal ground distances.

The Minnesota High Accuracy Reference Network (HARN) observations resulted in a readjustment of the geodetic network based on the NAD 83 Datum. The HARN observations completed during the period of 1993-1996 using high precision GPS techniques, were adjusted by the National Geodetic Survey in December, 1996. After the observations were adjusted for the HARN, the entire geodetic network in Minnesota will be readjusted, holding the HARN stations fixed. The shifts of the NAD 83 (1986) adjustment compared to the NAD 83 (1996) HARN adjustment are relatively small for mapping purposes (+/- 0.03 ~  0.70 meters) but significant for geodetic surveys. The source scale is 1:24000 (USGS Quadrangle map) for scaled Latitudes and Longitudes of vertical control marks that have not been positioned by a horizontal control survey.

In January 2002, Mn/DOT began Federal Base Network (FBN) observations. The FBN provides spatial reference control that has some of the most precise accuracies available. FBN observations concluded in February 2002. This survey consisted of 54 stations on a 100 km grid spacing. 

In January 2004, Mn/DOT began the Cooperative Base Network (CBN) observations. This survey consisted of 454 stations on a 25 km spacing. Phase 1 observations concluded in May 2004. These observations included stations in Districts 1 and 2. Phase 2 observations began in October 2004 and concluded in May 2005. These observations included stations in Districts 3,4,6,7,8 and Metro Division.</procdesc>
