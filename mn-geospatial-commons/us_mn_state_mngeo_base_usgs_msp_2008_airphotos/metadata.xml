An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map.

Approximately twenty (20) photo identifiable control points were measured in the orthos and compared to the surveyed locations to ensure the horizontal accuracy.</horizpar></horizpa><vertacc><vertaccr>N/A</vertaccr></vertacc></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srcscale></srcscale></srcinfo><procstep><procdesc>USGS Processing Steps, April 2008

All photography was acquired using film cameras and accompanied by the collection of airborne Global Positioning System (GPS) data. All imagery was collected using Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) as a means to control the imagery. Orthorectification was performed with Intergraph's ImageStation OrthoPro software and the USGS National Elevation Dataset was used for the elevation model. Digital orthophotos were also radiometrically balanced in Intergraph's OrthoPro software.


Land Management Information Office (LMIC), now MnGeo, Processing Steps, August 2008

USGS delivered the imagery to the Land Management Information Center (now MnGeo) in TIF format in 195 tiles with no overlap. LMIC staff read them directly into a database and serves the images over the web via a WMS server in JPG format.</procdesc></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><indspref></indspref><direct>Raster</direct><mgmg3obj></mgmg3obj><mgmg3til></mgmg3til></spdoinfo><eainfo><overview><eaover>The original dataset consists of natural color imagery orthorectified to .3 meter pixel resolution, mosaicked into 1,500m tiles and delivered in GeoTIFF format.
