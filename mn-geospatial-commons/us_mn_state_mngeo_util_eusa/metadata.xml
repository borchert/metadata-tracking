The original source data were lines hand-drawn on county highway maps. The maps were scanned and georeferenced to serve as a background for on-screen digitizing. The utilities were then given an opportunity to review and correct the service areas. Changes filed with the Public Utilities Commission (eDockets) were also reviewed to update the areas.</abstract><purpose>The purpose of the project was to convert existing electric utility service area boundaries from paper to digital format in order to provide a statewide view of the service areas. Public Utility Commission eDocket filings can then be used to maintain this dataset.

Other goals and objectives:
1. Create a consistent, state-wide GIS dataset of EUSA, as vetted by the utilities
2. Achieve a positional accuracy of 1:24,000 (+/- 60 feet)
3. Identify (and eventually resolve) service area boundary issues
4. Create a cost-effective process for tracking and updates
5.

The accuracy of the boundary linework hand-drawn on the paper maps is approximately +/- 350 feet. When complicated boundaries were encountered, they were typically simplified by the vendor doing the update.

As boundaries are updated digitally using more detailed and accurate base information, the goal is to achieve an accuracy of +/- 60 feet.

The gaps and overlaps in the dataset result from utilities submitting boundary changes individually without working with the adjacent utility.</horizpar></horizpa><vertacc><vertaccr>not applicable</vertaccr></vertacc></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srcscale>24000</srcscale></srcinfo><procstep><procdesc>The origins of the dataset are the electric utility service area boundaries that had been hand-drawn on Minnesota Department of Transportation county highway maps on file with the Minnesota Department of Commerce in 2004. The maps were scanned, geo-referenced and digitized on screen. After the GIS dataset was created, the utilities were given several opportunities to update and improve the positional quality of the service areas. In 2013, the Public Utilities Commission requested that utilities submit the final changes by June 1, 2013. Those corrections were completed and the Commission made a determination that the dataset represented the official service area boundaries for the State of Minnesota on April 1, 2014. 

There were a number of key steps:

----- 2004 ----- 
The electric utility service area boundaries had been hand-drawn on county highway maps. The map scale is 1:63,360 for counties outside the Twin Cities metropolitan area, and 1:48,000 for counties within the metro area. Each map was scanned and converted to TIF and JPEG formats at 200 and 400 pixels-per-inch (PPI) by Historical Information Gatherers, Inc.

MnGeo staff  geo-referenced the 400 DPI JPEG images using ArcMap 8.2 software. Electric utility service area boundaries were on-screen digitized using the images in the background as reference. Each polygon was coded with the name of the utility. The information was in Esri coverage and shapefile format at the end of this step. 

When boundary lines followed public land survey (PLS), roads, lakeshores or other reference lines, the lines were snapped to the appropriate reference GIS layer: 
- DNR PLS40: http://deli.dnr.state.mn.us/metadata/pls_fortypy3.html 
- Mn/DOT BaseMap layers for roads, railroads, lakes, rivers (and possibly others): http://www.dot.state.mn.us/maps/gdma/gis-data.html 

----- 2005 ----- 
Converted data to personal geodatabase format using ArcGIS 9.1. This was done since the geodatabase format supports COGO (traverse), transactions and versioning. 

The geodatabase is composed of two feature data sets and one table: 1. EUSA, 2. PLS and 3. Docket_Table. 

1. EUSA feature data set has three components: 
Boundaries - a feature class of service area boundaries 
Service_Areas - a feature class of service areas as described in this metadata record. 
EUSA_Topology - The topology relationship between Boundaries and Service_Areas (see EUSA_Topology Properties below). 

2. PLS (Public Land Survey) feature data set contains the 87 feature classes (1 feature class for each of Minnesota's 87 counties) of Department of Natural Resources PLS 40, quarter-quarter section dataset, documented at: http://deli.dnr.state.mn.us/metadata/pls_fortypy3.html 

3. Docket_Table - This table contains the docket information from the original maps which were scanned. 

EUSA_Topology Properties: 
Boundaries - Must Be Covered By Boundary Of - Service_Areas 
Boundaries - Must Not Have Dangles 
Service_Areas - Must Not Overlap 
Service_Areas - Must Not Have Gaps 

----- 2006-2009 ----- 
Assessed utilities' mapping capabilities.
Delivered review materials to each utility in a format appropriate for their mapping capabilities (GIS, CAD, PDF or paper maps).
Requested that utilities review their boundaries with the adjoining utility and indicate whether they agreed or disagreed.
Adjusted boundaries based on corrections received from the utilities.

----- 2010 ----- 
Adjusted electric utility service areas based on corrections received from the utilities. A boundary table was created which tracked utility agreement/disagreement with an adjoining utility. New corrections were cataloged. Technical assistance was provided to the utilities to help them through the process of submitting their changes. New maps were created and distributed to the utilities.

----- September 2012 ----- 
Continued to adjust service areas based on materials received from the utilities. In preparation for the public release, PUC announced that the Commission would make a determination on the boundaries.

A website was created: http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/eusa. The website has the ability to link to PUC's eDockets system from the dockets layer (years: 1999-2010) or the docket table (years: 1976-2005).

Working from smallest to larger, gaps and overlaps were reviewed for elimination. Errors under the accuracy (+-40 feet) of the data were typically removed and boundaries changed to the corrected boundary. Larger errors were sometimes repaired if no visible structures were affected and the boundaries were in general agreement.

The gaps and overlaps were created by utilities correcting boundaries independently. Sometimes these areas are legitimate disagreements but others could be quickly resolved if the utilities reviewed each other's boundaries.

----- 2013 ----- 
Continued to adjust service areas based on materials received from the utilities earlier in the year. The Public Utilities Commission requested that the utilities submit their final corrections by June 1, 2013.

----- 2014 ----- 
Continued to adjust service areas based on materials received from the utilities. The corrections were submitted to the Public Utilities Commission to make a determination on the data. As of April 1, 2014, the data represents the official service territory boundaries for the State of Minnesota.
