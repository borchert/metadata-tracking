The seven counties were assembled into a common coordinate system.  No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties.  A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county.  (See section 5 of the metadata).  The attributes are the same for the polygon and points layers.  Not all attributes are populated for all counties.

The polygon layer contains one record for each real estate/tax parcel polygon within each county's parcel dataset.  Some counties have polygons for each individual condominium, and others do not.  (See Completeness in Section 2 of the metadata for more information.)  The points layer includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset.  The points are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon.  The primary example of this is the condominium, though some counties stacked polygons for condos.  Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units.  Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset.  The points for the point dataset often will be randomly placed or stacked within the parcel polygon with which they are associated.  

The polygon layer is broken into individual county shape files.  The points layer is provided as both individual county files and as one file for the entire metro area.

In many places a one-to-one relationship does not exist between these parcel polygons or points and the actual buildings or occupancy units that lie within them.  There may be many buildings on one parcel and there may be many occupancy units (e.g. apartments, stores or offices) within each building.  Additionally, no information exists within this dataset about residents of parcels.  Parcel owner and taxpayer information exists for many, but not all counties.

Polygon and point counts for each county are as follows (Updated annually, current as of 1/15/2015:

      polygons / points
Anoka - 130633 / 130633
Carver - 40198 / 40198
Dakota - 139405 / 152816 
Hennepin - 427762 / 427762
Ramsey - 152210 / 166612
Scott - 55927 / 55927
Washington - 106151 / 106151 

This is a MetroGIS Regionally Endorsed dataset. 

Each of the seven Metro Area counties has entered into a multiparty agreement with the Metropolitan Council to assemble and distribute the parcel data for each county as a regional (seven county) parcel dataset.

A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county. The attributes are identical for the point and polygon datasets. Not all attributes fields are populated by each county. Detailed information about the attributes can be found in the &lt;a href="MetroGIS_Regional_Parcels_Attributes_2014.pdf" target=_blank&gt;MetroGIS Regional Parcels Attributes 2014&lt;/a&gt; document. 

Additional information may be available in the individual metadata for each county at the links listed below.  Also, any questions or comments about suspected errors or omissions in this dataset can be addressed to the contact person listed in the individual county metadata.

Under these licensing requirements, this dataset is available through MetroGIS at no cost to organizations that qualify as ''Governmental '' or ''Academic'' interests. 

''Governmental Interests'' means all local, regional, state and federal governmental jurisdictions, including their respective political subdivisions, in the United States.

''Academic Interests'' means an accredited college or university or any other institution of higher education in the United States.

Individuals and organizations, which do not qualify as governmental or academic interests, must contact the county(ies) directly for access.  A license may be required and a fee may be assessed.  Contact information can be found at http://www.metrogis.org/how-do-i-get/parcel-data.aspx

All other organizations and individuals must obtain the dataset directly from each county. In some cases a license and/or a fee is required. Below, in the Ordering Instructions, is information about some metro counties who have free and open access to their data.

The license agreement sets forth the conditions that the user must observe when using the Regional Parcel Dataset.  The person requesting this dataset is expected to communicate these conditions to all individuals in their respective organizations that will have access to this dataset.  

Licensed Public Parties have the right to use the data only for their own internal business purposes.  No redistribution is permitted.

Products made using the regional parcel dataset, including paper maps, .pdf files or other images of a finished map, are not subject to the provisions of the Parcel Data Sharing Agreement.  Licensed users may distribute such map products in a manner they desire, provided the underlying source electronic parcel data are not accessible by the map recipient(s).  

The license agreement is a site license.  Multiple copies of the data may be used by a licensed organization. 

Licensed Public Parties may have a Third Party use these data on their behalf, but the Third Party cannot use the data for any other purpose.  A Third Party must obtain a license in addition to the license required for the qualifying Public Party interest.  The Public Party is responsible for providing the data or password to its Third Party and ensuring compliance with the license conditions concerning use of the data by their Third Party.

A Third Party user may include any interest that obtains access to the dataset for the express purpose of assisting a Public Party in utilizing the data.</useconst><browse><browsen>ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metrogis/plan_regonal_parcels_2014/metadata/preview.jpg</browsen><browsed>Sample map showing the MetroGIS Regional Parcel Data.</browsed></browse><crossref><citeinfo><title>Regional Parcel Dataset - Seven County Twin Cities Metropolitan Area

Inclusion of Condominiums in Polygon Dataset:
Some counties include condominium information within their polygon dataset and others do not.  Some information on this topic is shown below.  Contact each county for further information.

Anoka:
Individual condominiums are included within the polygon dataset by subdividing the larger, common area parcel polygon of the condos into smaller polygons.  These smaller polygons do not represent the actual geography of the condominiums, but do lie within the larger condo parcel.

Carver, Hennepin and Scott
Individual condominiums are included within the polygon dataset using stacked polygons with the same geography for each condominium tax parcel.

Dakota, Ramsey and Washington
One polygon is included in the polygon dataset for the geography of the larger common area of a condominium building or complex.  Individual condominium units are only represented in the points dataset.

Note:  For Carver County, where a point represents a tax parcel that has multiple, noncontiguous polygons, a single point will be placed within one of the polygons.</complete><posacc><horizpa><horizpar>See the Data Quality section of the metadata for individual counties at the following links:
