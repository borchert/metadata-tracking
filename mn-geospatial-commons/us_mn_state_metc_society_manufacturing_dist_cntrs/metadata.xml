PROCESSING STEPS FOR THE JOB CONCENTRATIONS LAYER:
Minnesota Dept. of Employment and Economic Development's (MNDEED) 2012 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) is point-based, geocoded-worksite employment data.  Using Spatial Analysis, the Kernal Density tool was used to create a density surface of those qualifying jobs.
