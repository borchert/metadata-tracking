      <abstract>The 2000 Generalized Land Use dataset encompasses the seven county Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul) Metropolitan Area in Minnesota.  The dataset was developed by the Metropolitan Council, a regional governmental organization that deals, in part, with regional issues and long range planning for the Twin Cities area.  The data were interpreted from 2000 air photos, with additional assistance from county parcel data and assessor's information.  

The land use classification scheme has been expanded somewhat from that used in previous versions of the generalized land use data.  The following generalized land use classes are used (some of which have subclasses):   

Single Family Residential
Multifamily Residential
Office
Retail and Other Commercial
Mixed Use
Industrial and Utility
Extractive
Institutional
Park, Recreational, or Preserve
Golf Course
Major Highway
Railway
Airport
Agriculture
Undeveloped
Water

See Section 5 of the metadata for a detailed description of each of these land use categories and available subcategories.

Note:  This dataset does not attempt to delineate what lands might be considered developable.  This dataset does contain an 'Undeveloped' land category.  The definition of that category can be found in Section 5 of this metadata.

Updated 01/07/03:  The land use codes were changed for two water bodies surrounded by large wetland areas in southwestern Belle Plaine Township and northwestern Maple Plain.  During the original 2000 interpretation, a large area surrounding the open water was also codes as open water for these lakes.  These areas have been updated and are no longer coded as open water.</abstract>
      <purpose>To aid in forecasting region-wide land supply and demand and to be used as a general regional planning tool.  This data does not indicate developability of land, but does show the location of 'Undeveloped' land based on the definition described in Section 5 of this metadata.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Twin Cities 7 County Metropolitan Area.  This includes the counties of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington in Minnesota.</supplinf>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>During the land use interpretation, digital orthophotos and county parcel data with assessor's land use/type attributes were used.  Reverse directories and field checks were used to augment this interpretation.  Also, comments and corrections for the 2000 data from the cities and townships (each of which was given a map with the preliminary 2000 data) were used to update the 2000 layer.

Known deficiencies in the dataset include:

- The only delineated roads are those with at least 4 lanes, controlled access and a 200 ft. right-of-way, and all 4-lane roads with a Metropolitan Council functional class designation of 'Principal Arterial.'  All other roads are incorporated into the adjacent land use category.
- The only delineated railroads are those with at least 2 tracks side-by-side and they are classified as 'Railway'.  All single track railroads are incorporated into the adjacent land use category.  
- The interpretation of the 'Institutional' and 'Park, Recreational or Preserve' classes can be fuzzy.  For example, ball fields adjacent to a school are classed as Institutional if owned by the school district, while ball fields adjacent to a school that are not owned by the school district are classified as 'Park, Recreational or Preserve'.
- Some Horticultural specialty land uses (the growing of nursery stock, flowers, seeds, sod, and food crops grown indoors) are included in the 'Industrial' category where they could be delineated (e.g. large greenhouses that do not sell to the public).  However, most of these facilities that are out of doors are included in the 'Agricultural' class.
- The interpretation of a discernable shoreline for a body of open water or flowing waterway may vary.  In many cases, the shoreline was taken to the treeline.</attraccr>

    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Estimating the horizontal positional accuracy of this layer is somewhat complicated, because a number of factors must be considered.  For this reason, a description of some of these factors seems instructive.

Many of the boundaries defining land uses in urban areas were drawn along parcel lines based on parcel data from the metro counties.  Metro county parcel datasets vary greatly in positional accuracy as well as in the documentation of that accuracy.  Furthermore, positional accuracy may vary for different features within the same parcel dataset.  An additional factor is the degree to which Metropolitan Council staff matched the parcel boundaries in heads-up digitizing within ArcGIS.  The scale at which lines were digitized varied as staff zoomed in and out while heads-up digitizing within ArcGIS, however most lines were digitized at an on-screen scale of no higher than 1:3000.  In highly urbanized areas, 1:1500 was more common.

In rural areas, parcel boundaries were often not used.  Rural residential land use boundaries were defined by the mowed lawns or used areas around the dwellings as viewed on the Metropolitan Council 2000 digital orthophotos.  For this reason a positional accuracy estimate would have to describe the accuracy with which the interpreted boundary of this area was defined as well as whether the interpretation of the boundary was correct or inaccurate (causing a positional error).

A variety of other factors play a role in the positional accuracy of this layer.  The information in the Entity and Attribute Detailed Citation (Section 5 of the metadata) may shed light on some positional issues with respect to this dataset.

As a general rule when developing this dataset it was the Metropolitan Council's intention to meet the National Mapping Accuracy Standards at 1:24,000 (within approximately 40 feet of actual location).  No testing has been conducted to verify this.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>DATA SOURCES:
-  2000 digital orthophoto quarter quads (0.6 meter resolution)
-  1997 land use delineations
-  parcel data from all seven counties
-  The Lawrence Group's road centerline layer
-  reverse directories and field checks
-  community feedback from preliminary maps sent out to them

HISTORY OF THE LAND USE DATA:
The Metropolitan Council has conducted analyses of land use for the years 1966, '70, '74/'75, '78, '80, '84, '90, '97 and 2000.  Each project included analysis of aerial photography as well as field checks and the use of other sources to delineate land use and land use change.

Land use maps were developed from these data for the years 1966, '75, '84, '90, '97 and 2000.  In addition, reports on land use change were prepared for the periods of 1960-1975, 1970-1978, 1970-1980, 1980-1990, 1990-1997 and 1997-2000.

PROCESSING STEPS FOR THE 2000 LAND USE LAYER:
The 2000 land use layer was developed on the base of the 1997 land use dataset.  The primary tools used for the 2000 land use interpretation were the 2000 digital orthophotos and county parcel data with assessor's attributes indicating various land use type information. 

It is important to note that the assessor's attributes varied greatly from county to county.  In many cases the land type or use categories used by the county for assessment purposes did not match the categories used in this dataset.  The assessors attributes were matched as closely as possible to Council land use categories.  Additionally the property owner name from the parcel data and entries in reverse directories were used as aides in the land use interpretation.   Where these sources were insufficient to determine the land use category, field checks were performed. 

Once the preliminary 2000 land use dataset was completed, each of the approximately 200 cities and townships within the metro area was sent a map of the preliminary data and asked to provide comments and corrections.  86% of the the cities and townships responded and their comments were used to enhance the accuracy of the 2000 land use data.

The original categories used for land use breakdowns were established in 1962 and were modified only slightly through the preceding years of generating the Twin Cities generalized land use maps (1966, 1975, 1984, 1990, 1997).  For 2000, the categories changed significantly.  The classes for 2000 are described in the Entity and Attribute Overview section.  Included in the class descriptions are various decisions that were made related to delineating each land use class.

The interpretation was conducted on 7.5 minute quadrangles (USGS quads).  The editing was done using ArcInfo 8.1 desktop software.  Once completed, the geodatabase tiles were converted to polygon ArcInfo coverages and then the tiles were combined into one metro wide layer, where small sliver polygons were removed and other miscellaneous editing was done.  The 2000 land use layer was then dissolved out of the 1984-90-97-2000 combined layer.</procdesc>

      <eadetcit>The original categories used for land use breakdowns were established in 1962 and were modified only slightly prior to 2000.  For 2000 the categories have been expanded significantly.  The classes for the 2000 land use dataset are as follows:


SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL 
Land used exclusively for residential purposes and containing a single dwelling unit.  Includes the following four codes:

111 - FARMSTEAD
Land that encompasses the single family residential dwelling and associated buildings of a farm.  Associated buildings of a farm may include buildings used for animal husbandry (barns, chicken coops, grain solos, etc.) along with accessory uses, provided that such accessory uses are incidental to the agricultural activities.

112 - SEASONAL/VACATION
Land meeting the general definition of residential and containing a single dwelling unit occupied seasonally or used as vacation property.

113 - SINGLE FAMILY DETACHED
Land meeting the general definition of residential and not having more than one dwelling unit on the same lot.

116 - MANUFACTURED HOUSING PARK
Land meeting the general definition of residential dwelling and used for the placement of manufactured housing.


MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL
Land used exclusively for residential multiple-family dwellings containing a building or multiple buildings.  Includes the following two codes:

114 - SINGLE FAMILY ATTACHED
Land meeting the general definition of residential containing two or more attached dwelling units, each of which has primary ground floor access to the outside.  Examples:  town home, double bungalow, etc.

115 - MULTIFAMILY
Land meeting the general definition of residential containing two or more attached dwelling units, one or more of which does not have primary ground floor access to the outside.  Examples:  Apartment building, condominium with a main entrance for all residents.

Note:  Where  it was not possible to differentiate between these two categories based on aerial photography  and assessors data,  the next criteria for differentiation was the number of units.  If an indistinguishable parcel contained two to four units, it was coded Single Family Attached.  If it had 5 or more units, it was coded Multifamily.  If the number of units also was not available, then the final distinction was made using  the house like test.  If it looked like a house from the photo (e.g. large house split into apartments), it was classified as Single Family Attached, otherwise it became Multifamily.


130 - OFFICE
Land used predominantly for administrative, professional, or clerical services.  Examples:  law offices, accounting firms, clinics (but not hospitals), and veterinary clinics.  Government office buildings are generally categories as Institutional.  However, where government offices are housed on a privately owned parcel (e.g. leased office space), they may be included in the Office category.


120 - RETAIL AND OTHER COMMERCIAL
Land used for the provision of goods or services.  This category is for general sales and services that comprise the vast majority of establishments typically associated with commercial land use.  This category is used as the default for commercial/retail land uses.  Examples:  store, restaurant, hotel, bank, daycare facility, mini-storage facility, Metrodome, Excel Center,  Canterbury Downs, YMCA, American Legion, skeet club/outdoor gun range (large game/gun clubs - 80 acres or more - will be coded as Park and Rec).


MIXED USE
Land containing a building with mixed uses.  Includes the following three codes:

141 - MIXED USE RESIDENTIAL
Land containing a building with any residential units in addition to commercial or office uses.  Examples:  Galtier Plaza, small store with living space above it.

142 - MIXED USE INDUSTRIAL
Land containing a building with predominantly industrial use but also containing commercial or office use, but with no residential use.  Example:  a building containing a warehouse, offices, and stores.

143 - MIXED USE COMMERCIAL AND OTHER
Land containing a building with mixed uses but with predominantly commercial, office or other uses, but with no residential or industrial uses.  Example:  a building containing commercial shops, childcare facility, offices, and/or restaurants.  Downtown areas usually have buildings where the first and/or second floor is commercial and the rest is office (e.g. Lawson Software Building), these types of buildings would be coded under this category.


151 - INDUSTRIAL AND UTILITY
Land containing manufacturing, transportation, construction, communications, utilities or wholesale trade.  This category includes publicly owned industrial lands (e.g., wastewater treatment plants, water towers, large transit garages, DOT road sanding stockpiles or maintenance staging areas).  Industrial also includes: warehouses, some special horticultural uses (e.g. large greenhouses that do not sell to the public), landfills, and automotive junk yards (even if they sell retail, SIC 5015).  Radio and TV stations were also included in this category.


153 - EXTRACTIVE 
Land containing extractive industry (Gravel Pits and Quarries). 


160 - INSTITUTIONAL
Land used primarily for religious, governmental, educational, social, cultural or major health care facilities (where they have beds for overnight stay).  Examples:  schools, synagogues, cemeteries, hospitals, nursing homes, city halls, county and state fairgrounds, and museums.  This category includes all publicly owned land that is not clearly in any other category (e.g. not in Office, Parks, or Industrial, etc.).  Clinics and health care facilities with only  outpatient procedures will be classified as Office, NOT Institutional.  Government office buildings are generally categories as institutional.  However, where government offices are housed on a privately owned parcel (e.g. leased office space), they may be included in the Office category.


170 - PARK, RECREATIONAL OR PRESERVE
Land used for park and recreational sport assembly or passive open space.  This may occur at community level fields, regional parks, public parks, private parks, campgrounds, small urban parks, playgrounds, rest areas, and other venues used for indoor and outdoor sporting events or like purposes.  This category also includes recreational passive activities or land use areas, such as park preserves, wildlife refuges, habitat areas, public plazas, river walks, DNR or US Fish and Wildlife owned land, and greenways.  The category also include a small number of 'non-developable' areas based on Planned Unit Developments (PUD).  Areas designated as PUD represent open areas within or adjacent to urban development (i.e. housing)  which together fulfill or meet overall density guidelines for such urban developments as outlined by the city.


173 - GOLF COURSE
Land used for golfing, including driving range and practice areas.  


201 - MAJOR HIGHWAY
Major vehicular rights-of-way  that meet one or more of the following conditions:  interstate highway; 4-lane divided highway with right-of-way of 200 feet or greater in width; 4-lane road with a Metropolitan Council functional class designation of Principal Arterial.  NOTE:  Frontage roads may be included in this category where they are closely aligned to a major highway and are and within its right-of-way.    Areas within the legal right-of-way  that clearly have a different use (such as agriculture) are not included in this category.  


202 - RAILWAY
Land used and occupied or intended to be occupied by multiple railroad track lines or similar uses.  This includes railroad classification, storage and repair yards; intermodal containerized freight and transload facilities; railroad depots, etc. that might otherwise  be classified under as industrial Note:  Single-track railroads are not delineated..


203 - AIRPORT
Land used for the operation of aircraft and any related uses that are on the airport property.  (For example, a parking lot or car rental on airport property would be included since they are related to the airport, but ball fields on the airport property would not be included.)


100 - AGRICULTURAL
Broad range of agricultural uses, including horse boarding and training, kennels, sod farms, tree farms, fish production and processing, storage areas or buildings, as well as land used for agricultural purposes having determined the existence of ground tillage or crop rows.  Agricultural buildings (including feedlots) that are not surrounding a farmstead, were included in  this category.  Other areas of farming are also included, such as horticulture, floriculture (exotic flowers), viticulture (grapes) and pasture.  NOTE:  It is not possible to discern all agricultural lands based on the available data (aerial photography and assessors data).  Thus, some agricultural land may be placed in the Undeveloped  category. 


210 - UNDEVELOPED
Land not currently used for any defined purpose that may or may not contain buildings or other structures.  This also includes agricultural areas that have no discernable agricultural use based upon the available data (aerial photography and assessor's data).


220 - WATER
A body of open water or flowing waterway with a discernable shoreline.   This typically does not include wetlands or periodically flooded areas.  Generally only features three acres or greater in size were delineated.  Areas definable as another land use type will not be depicted as in the Water category (e.g. major highway bridge over a river and marina)</eadetcit>
