      <abstract>This is a polygon dataset for county boundaries as well as for cities, township and unorganized territory (CTU) boundaries in the Twin Cities 7-county metropolitan area as of April 2000.  This dataset will be kept static as of this date to be used with 2000 census data and other year 2000 data.  

This dataset is composed of three shape files and a lookup table. 

Census2000Counties.shp = county boundaries

Census2000CTUs.shp = city, township and unorganized territory boundaries

Census2000CountiesAndCTUs.shp = combined county and CTU boundaries

Census2000CountyCTULookupTable.dbf = a lookup table containing various data related to cities, townships, unorganized territories and any divisions created by county boundaries splitting them.


NOTES:

- The five digit CTU codes in this dataset are identical to the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) ''Place'' codes.  They are also used by the Census Bureau and many other organizations and are proposed as a MN state data coding standard.

- Cities and townships have also been referred to as ''MCDs'' (a census term), however this term technically refers to the part of each city or township within a single county.  Thus, a few cities in the metro area that are split by county boundaries are actually comprised of two different MCDs. This was part of the impetus for a proposed MN state data standard that uses the ''CTU'' terminology for clarity.

- The boundary line data for this dataset comes primarily from each county, with MN/DOT data being used in Anoka County.

-  A variety of civil divisions of the land exist within the United States.  In Minnesota, only three types exist - cities, townships and unorganized territories.  All three of these exist within the Twin Cities seven county area.  The only unorganized territory is Fort Snelling (a large portion of which is occupied by the MSP International Airport).

-  Some cities are split between two counties.  Only those parts of cities within the 7-county area are included.

- Prior to the 2000 census, the FIPS Place code for the City of Greenwood in Hennepin County was changed from 25928 to 25918.  This dataset reflects that change to match 2000 U.S. Census data.</abstract>

    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The estimated positional accuracy of the dataset varies with the source of the data as follows:

Anoka County
Used MnDOT's 1996 Municipal and County boundaries layers from ''BaseMap '97'' CD.  Positional accuracy estimate is 40 ft.  Boundary changes since 1996 were derived from paper city Comprehensive Plan Amendments digitized using Metropolitan Council digital orthophotos for reference.  Lines are estimated to generally have a 40 ft. positional accuracy.  No testing of the positional accuracy has been done.
Note:  When compared to a municipal boundary dataset received from Anoka County in 2002, postional differences of up to 50 meters were observed in a some places.

Carver County
County has GPS data for all 1/4 Section corners accurate to 1/50th foot.  Township boundaries that follow PLS lines are estimated at between 0.2 ft. and 0.5 ft. of true location. City boundaries that follow PLS lines are also expected to be near this range of accuracy. Other boundaries are within .5' to 5' of horizontal accuracy.

Dakota County
Estimated +or- 0.2 feet on lines that follow the PLS or well described parcels.  90% of lines are estimated to be within 0.5 feet of true location.  Some problem areas exist.  For example, many questions exist as to where the boundary of Mendota is supposed to be.

Hennepin County
Estimated +or- 2 to 4 feet at section corners.  Positional accuracy decreases with distance from section corners.

Ramsey County
The majority of the municipal boundary layer possesses a horizontal positional accuracy equivalent to that of our digitized parcels.  (+-7 feet) Exceptions to this include unresolved boundary issues and interpreted boundary positions such as the thread of the Mississippi River.  Some areas could deviate in position by more than 100 feet.  Further municipal boundary annexation information may be found at the Minnesota Planning agency,  the municipality in question or at the Minnesota Department of Transportation which performs most annexation mapping functions.  Public Land Survey (PLS) and parcel mapping information can be found at the Ramsey County Surveyors Office.

Scott County
Township boundaries that follow PLS lines are estimated at between 0.4 ft. and 1 ft. of true location.  City boundaries that follow PLS lines are also expected to be near this range of accuracy.  Other boundaries are thought to be within 20 or 40 ft.

Washington County
Boundaries shown that coincide with hydrological features or those that have generalized definitions with little supporting detail of their location are digitized from partially rectified aerial photographs at 1 inch equals 200 feet. These features have been tested 23 feet horizontal accuracy at the 95% confidence level using NSSDA testing procedures except in areas of high vertical relief where such features tested 120 feet horizontal accuracy by use of other testing procedures. Boundaries defined as center of main channel on Mississippi and St. Croix rivers are approximations only (source U.S.G.S. quadrangle maps). All other boundary segments are generated by coordinate geometry based on a framework of accurately located PLSS corner positions. Legal boundary definitions were interpreted and analyzed according to records available and are not based on field survey. The nature of these definitions present situations where documents of record may not coincide with known ground position or that their ambiguity makes it difficult to identify precise ground location. As a result, caution is necessary in use of the municipal boundary data when using it in site specific applications. For more information contact the Washington County Surveyor's Office.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>SOURCES USED:

This dataset consist of lines from several sources.  They are:
 - Carver County
 - Dakota County
 - Hennepin County
 - Ramsey County
 - Scott County
 - Washington County
 - Minnesota Department of Transportation (used for Anoka County)
 - City comprehensive plan amendments (used in Anoka County)


ASSEMBLING THE DATA: 

Linework was taken directly as provided from the counties with the following exceptions:  

Anoka County lines were derived from January 1996 MNDOT data.  Where annexations occurred in Anoka Co. since 1996, the CTU boundaries were digitized from city comprehensive plan amendment maps using the Metropolitan Council digital orthophotos as a reference. 

Hennepin County linework is derived from CTU boundaries received from Hennepin Co. in 1998.  Linework for boundary changes since that time was taken from 2002 CTU boundary data provided by Hennepin County.  Note Hennepin County has made a number of changes to the alignment of CTU boundaries between the 1998 data and the 2002 data.  The 1998 data is the primary source for this 2000 CTU dataset.


County boundaries were taken from the county datasets as follows:

Dakota/Scott boundary:  Dakota County dataset was used.

Dakota/Washington:  Dakota County dataset was used.

Washington/Ramsey:  Washington County dataset was used.

Dakota/Ramsey:  Dakota County dataset was used.

Hennepin/Ramsey:  Ramsey County dataset was used with the the exception of one strip in the south along the river.

Scott/Hennepin: Hennepin County dataset was used.

Carver/Hennepin: Hennepin County dataset was used.

Carver/Scott:  Carver County dataset was used with the exception of one segment where the Carver data appeared to go over land in Scott County as viewed on the Met. Council's orthophotos.

Ramsey/Anoka: Ramsey County dataset was used.

Washington/Anoka: Washington County dataset was used.

Hennepin/Anoka:  Hennepin County dataset was used.



Washington County Note:  Digital mapping of the city and township boundaries by Washington County resulted in the discovery of three separate polygon areas, where each was found not to have a corresponding FIPS place code.  These polygons fall with the water bodies of the Mississippi and St. Croix Rivers and are the result of an apparent discrepancy in the chain of record defining city and township boundaries for their adjoining city or township.  They have been merged with adjacent cities or townships in this dataset.</procdesc>
