IMPORTANT NOTES: 

These TAZ forecasts will change multiple times over the next few years. 

The Metropolitan Council will ask cities and townships to allocate their TAZ forecasts as part of their 2018 Comprehensive Plan Update (go to  http://www.metrocouncil.org/Handbook/Plan-Elements/Transportation.aspx 
for more information about this process). Communities may also revise their current TAZ forecasts before the 2018 Comprehensive Plan Update.   In the meantime, the Council provides these Current TAZ forecasts for transportation planning.

If you are using TAZ forecasts for analysis and/or transportation planning, please download the latest version of this shapefile to ensure you are using the most up-to-date data.

If you represent a community that wants to revise your TAZ forecasts, please contact your community's sector representative or  Dennis Farmer (see contact information at the end of this document).</abstract><supplinf>The Twin Cities 7 county Metropolitan Area</supplinf></descript><timeperd><current>TAZ forecasts will be updated periodically as cities and townships review and comment on the TAZ forecasts, or as new data becomes available.  The Council will ask all cities to review their TAZ forecasts as part of their Comprehensive Plan Update in 2018.

These TAZ forecasts replace a previous set of TAZ forecasts the Council published October 2014.  Those forecasts were based on the Thrive MSP 2040 community forecasts adopted in May 2013.  

In July 2015, the Council adopted updated community forecasts in preparation for issuing System Statements  for communities to use in their 2018 Comprehensive Plan Updates.  

The Current TAZ Forecasts available here for download reflect those July 2015 updated forecasts, and any subsequent revisions.
