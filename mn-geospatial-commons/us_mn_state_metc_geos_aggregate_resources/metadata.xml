Reverse directories and field checks were used to augment this interpretation. Also, comments and corrections for the 1997 data from the cities and townships (each of which was given a map with the preliminary 1997 data) were used to update the 1997 layer.

The regional Growth Strategy map, 1996, (sometimes called the 2040 Growth Strategy) were developed by Metropolitan Council staff and approved by the Council in December of 1996. The policy areas are the Urban Core, the Urban Area, the Urban Reserve, Rural Growth Centers and Permanent Rural/Agricultural Areas in. In addition there is an illustrative 2020 Metropolitan Urban Service Area (MUSA). The positional accuracy of the dataset has not been tested under the National Standards for Spatial Data Accuracy. The positional accuracy of the dataset is estimated to be + or - 100 meters. The ''Illustrative 2020 MUSA'' category is basically a cartoon. It was put on the growth management map to convey the idea that there will be an interim 2020 MUSA. The actual boundaries have yet to be determined and may look VERY different. The positional accuracy of this category is therefore + or - many miles. 

Bedrock aggregate resources and sand and gravel aggregate resources data were mapped and captured at 1:24,000 scale. The bedrock areas represent significant potential deposits of Prairie du Chien dolostone suitable for crushed aggregate with less than 10 ft of overlying material. The deposits are classified according to thickness and reliability of the mapping. The sand and gravel deposits are classified according to type and quality (based on percent of gravel content), thickness of deposit, amount of overlying material, relationship to water table, and reliability of the mapping.</attraccr></attracc><logic>The dataset is topologically 'clean'.</logic><complete>Entire seven county geographic area is covered.

HISTORY OF THE AGGREGATE RESOURCES DATA:
The Metropolitan Council has conducted analyses of aggregate resources for 1983, 1997, 2020 and 2040. 

Aggregate resources maps were developed from these data for the years 1983, 1997, 2020 and 2040. In addition, reports on aggregates were prepared for the periods of 1983-2010 and 1997-2040.

PROCESSING STEPS FOR THE 1997, 2020 and 2040 AGGREGATE RESOURCES LAYERS:
The bedrock geology and sand and gravel data were classified as to types, quality (percent of gravel content), thickness of overburden, position relative to the water table, and reliability of the mapping.

The following categories were established:

- Class A: Dolostone (Prairie du Chien ) thickness greater than 30 feet; thickness set at 50 feet for volume computation purpose. 
- Class B: Dolostone (Prairie du Chien ) thickness between 10 and 30 feet; thickness set at 20 feet for volume computation purpose. 
- Class C: Dolostone (Prairie du Chien ) thickness less than 10 feet. This class was not used in computing volume of aggregate resources. 
- Class 1: &lt;20% of bulk natural aggregate retained on #4 sieve, and/or sand and gravel deposit &lt;20 feet thick, and/or overburden &gt;10 feet thick; water table &lt;20 feet deep; subsurface data limited; gravel poor deposits; or deposit &lt; 10 feet with good subsurface data. Class not included in computing volume of aggregate resources. 
- Class 2: Des Moines Lobe deposits; &gt;20% of bulk natural aggregate retained on #4 sieve; deposit &gt;20 feet thick; overburden &lt;10 feet thick; water table is shallow (&lt; 20 feet); good to limited subsurface data. Material poor to moderate quality. Thickness set at 20 feet for computing volume of aggregate resources. 
- Class 3: Des Moines Lobe deposits; &gt;20% of bulk natural aggregate retained on #4 sieve; deposit &gt;20 feet thick; overburden &lt;10 feet thick; water table is shallow (&lt; 20 feet); good to limited subsurface data. Material moderate to good quality. Thickness set at 20 feet for computing volume of aggregate resources. 
- Class 4: Superior Lobe deposits; &gt;20% of bulk natural aggregate retained on #4 sieve; deposit &gt;20 feet thick; overburden &lt;10 feet thick; water table is shallow (&lt; 20 feet); good to limited subsurface data. Material good to excellent quality. Thickness set at 20 feet for computing volume of aggregate resources. 
- Class 5: Des Moines Lobe deposits; &gt;20% of bulk natural aggregate retained on #4 sieve; deposit 10- 40 feet thick; overburden &lt;10 feet thick; water table deeper than 20 feet; good to limited subsurface data. Material poor to moderate quality. Thickness set at 20 feet for computing volume of aggregate resources. 
- Class 6: Des Moines Lobe deposits; &gt;20% of bulk natural aggregate retained on #4 sieve; deposit 10- 40 feet thick; overburden &lt;10 feet thick; water table deeper than 20 feet; good to limited subsurface data. Material moderate to good quality. Thickness set at 20 feet for computing volume of aggregate resources. 
- Class 7: Superior Lobe deposits; &gt;20% of bulk natural aggregate retained on #4 sieve; deposit 10- 40 feet thick; overburden &lt;10 feet thick; water table deeper than 20 feet; good to limited subsurface data. Material good to excellent quality. Thickness set at 20 feet for computing volume of aggregate resources. 
- Class 8: Existing sand and gravel pits; remaining volume of resources unknown and not used in computing aggregate resources. 
- Class 9: &gt;20% of bulk natural aggregate retained on #4 sieve; deposit &gt; 40 feet thick; overburden &lt;10 feet thick; water table deeper than 20 feet; good subsurface data. Material poor to moderate quality. Class not used in computing volume of aggregate resources. 
- Class 10: Des Moines Lobe deposits; &gt;20% of bulk natural aggregate retained on #4 sieve; deposit &gt; 40 feet thick; overburden &lt;10 feet thick; water table deeper than 20 feet; good subsurface data. Material moderate to good quality. Thickness set at 40 feet for computing volume of aggregate resources. 
- Class 11: Superior Lobe deposits; &gt;20% of bulk natural aggregate retained on #4 sieve; deposit &gt; 40 feet thick; overburden &lt;10 feet thick; water table deeper than 20 feet; good subsurface data. Material good to excellent quality. Thickness set at 40 feet for computing volume of aggregate resources.

The 1997 land use layer was developed on the base of the 1990 land use dataset. The primary tools used for the 1997 land use interpretation were the 1997 digital orthophotos and county parcel data with assessors attributes indicating various land use type information. 

The following land use categories constituted the urbanized areas and were deemed to encumber aggregate resources when the footprint of these land uses together with a specified buffer area overlaid an aggregate resource deposit. 

- Single-family residential development with a 200-foot buffer
- Multi-family residential development with a 200-foot buffer
- Commercial development
- Industrial development
- Public and semi-public facilities
- Public Industrial land
- Airports
- Parks and recreation areas
- Streets and roadways with a 100-foot buffer on each side 
- Gravel pits and quarries

Such aggregate resource deposit was then removed from the 1997 Aggregate resources map and was not included in the volume computation.

Environmentally sensitive areas with an appropriate buffer were also removed from the original endowment in aggregate resources in the preparation of the 1997 aggregate resources map and in computing the volume of aggregates

- Streams and rivers together with a 200-foot wide buffer on each side 
- Wetlands 5 acres or more in size together with a 100-foot wide buffer around them
- Open water bodies together with a 100-foot wide buffer
- Scientific, natural and wildlife areas owned and managed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.

It should be noted that areas owned by environment or conservation-oriented groups such as Nature Conservancy, Audubon Society, Minnesota Land Trust, Trust For Public Land, or easements held by these organizations were not removed from the areas which could be mined. Specific geographic information on those land holdings or easements was not available.

In addition, for the 2020 aggregate resources layer, modifications of the 1997 aggregate resources available were made by removing aggregate deposits that were within the area identified on the Regional Growth Strategy coverage as the area to urbanize between 1997 and the Illustrative 2020 MUSA.

Similarly, for the 2040 Aggregate Resources layer, deposits that were within the area identified on the Regional Growth Strategy coverage as the area to urbanize beyond the Illustrative 2020 MUSA to the outer edge of the 2040 Urban Reserve were removed.

No attempt was made to simulate aggregate demand and translate that into geographic area from which the resources would be extracted. Therefore the coverages for 2020 and 2040 represent only the impact of encumbrance by the footprint of known 1997 urban uses and environmental constraints augmented by aggregate deposits encumbrance through land development between 1997 and 2020 and between 2020 and 2040.

The analysis was done using ArcView 3.2 software.

Note: Projections of remaining available 2020 and 2040 resources, as reported in the report Aggregate Resources Inventory of the Seven-County Metropolitan Area, Minnesota, 2000, D.L. Southwick, M. Jouseau, G.N. Meyer, J.H. Mossler, and T.E. Wahl reflect cumulative demand under several scenarios.</procdesc></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><indspref>None</indspref><direct>Vector</direct><mgmg3obj>polygon shapes</mgmg3obj><mgmg3til>One layer for entire seven county region.</mgmg3til></spdoinfo><eainfo><overview><eaover>dataset contains one attribute (apart from the default attribute
