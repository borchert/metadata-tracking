They help buses stay on schedule and move more people quickly and effectively within congested corridors for minimal investment.

The line geometry for transit advantage segments was derived from NCompass Technologies' Street Centerline dataset.  The Transit Advantages dataset identifies the location where transit vehicles are permitted to operate and mixed-traffic is prohibited or has limited access to operate.  Transit Advantages have been categorized by type which includes: bus lanes, bus ways, commuter rail, HOT lanes, light rail, meter bypasses, online stations and shoulder lanes.

Information within this data layer is subject to change and may not be complete.  Please refer to street signage and field conditions for the most accurate information.  </abstract><purpose>The Transit Advantages dataset identifies the location where transit vehicles are permitted to operate and mixed-traffic is prohibited or has limited access to operate within the Twin Cities Metropolitan area.</purpose><supplinf>Twin Cities 7 County Metropolitan Area.

SEGID:  A unique identification number for each transit advantagey segment.

ID:  A unique identification string for each transit advantage segment.

TYPE:  The physical construction of the transit advantage segment.

LOCATION:  The main roadway where the transit advantage exists.

DESC_:  A description of the transit advantage segment.

MODE:  A system for carrying transit passengers described by specific right-of-way, technology and operational facilities.  MB = bus, LRT = light rail transit, CRT = commuter rail transit.

NTD:  This binary classification provides inventory of transit advantages found in the Reportable (fixed guideway) Segments (P-40) form of the National Transit Database (NTD) annual report.

MILES:  The approximate length of a transit advantage segment in miles.</eaover><eadetcit>None</eadetcit></overview></eainfo><distinfo><resdesc>TransitAdvantages</resdesc><distliab>NOTICE:  The Geographic Information System (GIS) Data to which this notice is attached are made available pursuant to the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act (Minnesota Statutes Chapter 13).
