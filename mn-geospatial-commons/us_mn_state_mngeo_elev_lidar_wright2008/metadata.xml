Thus, the data format is not entirely consistent with some of the other LiDAR data collected for the State of Minnesota. Specifically, the Wright County collect required classification of only Bare Earth in the LiDAR LAS files, so there is no information on buildings, vegetation, or model key points.

Breaklines captured as part of this effort are also a bit different. In Wright County the breaklines are 3D Polyline features rather than 3D Polygon features. They also include road centerlines, stream courses and other features that are not part of the Statewide collect specifications.

Contours: LiDAR data was collected using Merrick's ALS50 sensor.  The data was field-verified for complete coverage of the project area.  Raw data files were parsed into manageable client-specific tiles.  These tiles were then processed through automated filtering that separated the data into different classification groups: error points, ground points, and canopy-building points.  The data was next taken into a graphic environment to reclassify the erroneous points that may remain in the LIDAR point cloud after auto filter.  The surface was then normalized into a digital surface model (DSM).  Final data extraction for the client's keypoint (statistically significant points) and canopy-building files were then generated.

Using orthophotography, planimetric features were compiled as breaklines to supplement the LiDAR data.  The LiDAR digital surface model was then processed with the breaklines, and contour lines were interpolated.  The contours were exported from Merrick's MARS software into ESRI shapefiles.  The contour data was checked for spikes and holes, and then imported into an Arc/Info coverage for building topology and coding contour types.  The coverage was then exported to an ESRI shapefile for delivery.

Breaklines: The breaklines were captured using Microstation v8. The resulting .dgn file was brought into ArcScene and exported to a 3d polyline shapefile (x, y, and z attributes). 

The deliverables from Merrick to Wright County were:  Digital orthos in TIFF and MrSID formats; DSM (LiDAR first return) in ASCII, binary LAS, and ESRI grid formats; DEM (LiDAR bare-earth) in ASCII, binary LAS, and ESRI grid formats; DTM (LiDAR bare-earth with breaklines) in ASCII, CSV (comma de-limited), binary LAS, and ESRI grid formats; Breaklines in 3D shapefile and DXF formats; 2-foot Contours in 3D shapefile and DXF formats; Spot elevations in 3D shapefile and DXF formats.  All deliveries were in the Wright County (MN) Coordinate System, North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83), NSRS 2007 adjustment, U.S. Survey foot.  The vertical datum was NAVD 88.


Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Processing Steps

1) LAS files were projected from County Coordinates to UTM Zone 15, NAD83
2) LAS point Z values were scaled from feet to meters
3) LAS files were retiled into the state tile scheme (1/16 of a USGS 1:24,000 scale quadrangle)
4) Breakline features were merged together into a single feature class
5) Breakline features were projected from County Coordinates to UTM Zone 15, NAD83
6) Breakline Z Values were scaled from feet to meters
7) LAS Bare Earth Points and breaklines were used to create a Terrain data type 
8) 1-meter DEM was derived from Terrain using nearest neighbor interpolation option (DEM01)
9) Hillshade was derived from 1-meter DEM (DEM01HS)
10) 3-meter DEM was derived from Terrain using nearest neighbor interpolation option (DEM03)
11) Hillshade was derived from 3-meter DEM (DEM03HS)
12) Aspect was derived from 3-meter DEM (DEM03ASPECT)
13) Slope in degrees was derived from 3-meter DEM (DEM03SLOPE_DEGREES)
14) Slope in percent was derived from 3-meter DEM (DEM03SLOPE_PERCENT)
15) DEM03 was smoothed using a 3x3 mean smoothing filter 
16) 2-foot contours were created from the smoothed 3-meter DEM

All DEMS are hydro-flattened and enforced using the breakline features.

All processing was done in December 2011 using ArcGIS V10 and LP360 Extensions.
