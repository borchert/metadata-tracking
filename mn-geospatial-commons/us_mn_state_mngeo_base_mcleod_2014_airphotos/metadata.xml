    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Radiometry is verified by visual inspection of the digital orthophoto.  Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>None</logic>
    <complete>All planned 2014 acquisition was completed. Orthoimages are visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or image misplacements exist within project limits and between adjacent images. These images are derived by mosaicking multiple images to ensure complete coverage. Source imagery is cloud free.

This data has an anomaly when displayed on MnGeo's Web Map Service. The data was prepared by the vendor as specified by the county in non-overlapping tiles in McLeod county coordinates. When the tiles are converted to UTM Zone 15, they do not overlap perfectly in the WMS due to rounding errors. This causes a white (offsite) dashed line, about 1/3 on and 2/3 off, to appear between the tiles in the finished product. The line is one-pixel wide, and thus only visible at the highest resolutions, scale factors of about 1:2000 or closer. When viewed at a resolution of one image pixel per display pixel (about 1:500 or so), about 10% of the scenes will contain the line.</complete>

        <procdesc>Sources:
1. Minnesota 10-foot DEM, used to provide ground elevations for orthorectification process.
2. MN 0.5-foot Area Aerotriangulation, Quantum Spatial, Inc., December 2014: Used to provide photo exterior orientations for orthorectification process.

Processing Steps:

The acquisition was done using multiple Intergraph DMCs (Digital Mapping Cameras) during 2014 Spring leaf-off conditions allowing for 5% snow and cloud cover. Digital camera(s) were calibrated by the manufacturer and the camera parameters refined through in-situ proprietary procedures. The flying height was 4850 feet AMT (above mean terrain) and imagery data was captured in 12-bit for four bands (Red-Green-Blue-Near Infrared). The data was then processed using Intergraph's PPS software into 12-bit, 4-band images which were then adjusted using Intergraph's DIA (DMC Image Analyst) software.

Airborne GPS and IMU data was processed and used in beginning the aerial triangulation (AT) processing which was done using INPHO's Match-AT software. The resulting exterior orientations for each frame were used along with the DMC images and a 10-foot gridded DEM generated from the downloaded statewide LiDAR datasets to do a rectification using INPHO's OrthoMaster software.

The orthorectified frames were then further adjusted using INPHO's OrthoVista - Radiometrix Editor and seamlines automatically generated.  Those seamlines were completely reviewed and edited to ensure no man-made features were clipped as well as to optimize seamline locations in general.  Once the seamlines were edited the images were mosaicked and big tiles were cut for review and editing purposes.

The big tiles were completely reviewed and calls made for warped bridges and other artifacts which were then corrected. Then a QC was performed on 10-15% of the tiles focusing on urban areas and other important features. Once all QC edits were complete the big tiles were then used to cut out the final tiles. Finally, the near-infrared band was adjusted per the client's direction and the images were formatted for final delivery.

Software versions:  IRAS C ver 10.0, Photoshop ver CS5,  Windows XP and Windows 7, INPHO OrthoVista 5.5, Global Mapper 13, Bentley MicroStation 7 and 8, INPHO Match-AT 5.5, INPHO OrthoMaster 5.5

The data was distributed to MnGeo in non-overlapping tiles in McLeod county coordinates. MnGeo converted the imagery to UTM Zone 15 coordinates and created a WMS service.</procdesc>
