Geologic studies include both near-surface deposits and bedrock. Ground water studies include flow systems, aquifer capacity, and ground water chemistry. In some areas sand and gravel deposits, sinkholes, or other features are studied. Interpretation of sensitivity to pollution is also part of an atlas. The information is organized, analyzed, and displayed using geographic information technology. 

The Scott County Geologic Atlas contains the following plates:
Plate 1: Database Map
Plate 2: Bedrock Geology
Plate 3: Surficial Geology
Plate 4: Quaternary Stratigraphy
Plate 5: Bedrock Topography, Depth to Bedrock, and Bedrock Geology Models
Plate 6: Subsurface Recharge and Surface Infiltration

Typically Minnesota Geologic Atlas projects are done in two parts.  Part A covers basic geology and creates databases of primary source information such as wells and soil borings. Part B covers hydrogeology and ground water sensitivity. Some ground water sensitivity-related information is covered in Plate 6 of this atlas. There will be no Part B for the Scott County Geologic Atlas.</abstract><purpose>County Geologic Atlas and Regional Hydrogeologic Assessment information is used in planning and environmental protection efforts at all levels of government. Wellhead protection and well-sealing programs are examples of local programs that need geologic and ground water information. The information is also used by businesses and the general public.</purpose><supplinf>Scott County, Minnesota</supplinf></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>2006</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><current>Digital files used to compile the Scott County Geologic Atlas were developed 2004-2006.

Building on the previous data, field studies are conducted to improve the understanding of local geologic and hydrologic conditions.
