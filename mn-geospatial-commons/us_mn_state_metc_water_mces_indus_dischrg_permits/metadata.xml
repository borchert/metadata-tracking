      <abstract>This layer contains data for the companies that have been issued an Industrial Discharge Permit by the Industrial Waste &amp; Pollution Prevention Section  of the Metropolitan Council Environmental Services Division.  MCES is delegated as the Control Authority to regulate the use of the public sanitary sewer system within the MCES seven county service area.  Companies are issued an Industrial Discharge Permit if they are determined to have a significant impact on the public sewer system.  These data also include permitted facilities outside of the seven county service area that hold a permit with MCES.  These permits are for wastewater hauled into the service area.

More information about the industrial waste program of the Metropolitan Council's Environmental Services Division  can be found at http://www.metrocouncil.org/Wastewater-Water/Services/Industrial-Waste.aspx.</abstract>
      <purpose>To provide a map for aiding in the scheduling of industrial wastewater monitoring projects for facilities that have been issued an Industrial Discharge Permit.</purpose>
      <supplinf>State of Minnesota with most of the data focused within the Twin Cities 7 County Metropolitan Area.</supplinf>

      <attraccr>No formal assessment of the attribute accuracy has been made. Some missing and inaccurate data is known to exist in the following fields:
- COUNTY
- CATEGORY
- ZIP</attraccr>

    <logic>The dataset is topologically 'clean'.</logic>
    <complete>Entire state is covered, although relatively few points exist beyond the seven county metro area.

See attribute accuracy for issues related to attribute completeness.</complete>

      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The positional accuracy of the dataset has not been tested under the National Standards for Spatial Data Accuracy.

Most of the points were established using a Trimble ProXR GPS, Model TSC1PN.  Typically a technician took a reading from the parking lot of the permitted facility.  In the situation where a GPS position has not been taken or it could not be obtained due to interference, a feature was added to the layer via heads-up digitizing using the Metropolitan Council's year 2000 ortho photos.</horizpar>

      <eaover>Point Attributes:
 
GPS_DATE:   Date a GPS location was taken or when the point was added to the 
            layer.
 
SOURCE:     GPS or MAP, GPS = An actual GPS location, MAP= Point was placed on 
            the layer using 2001 Ortho photos.
 
PERMITTXT:  Industrial Discharge Permit Number issued by MCES.  Permit numbers 
            above 2000 are for Permittees that are discharging either Leachate 
            or Contaminated Groundwater to the sanitary sewer system. 

COMPNAME:   Permittee's Name
 
FACADDRESS: Permitee's street address
 
COMMUNITY:  Permitee's community/city location
 
COUNTY:     County in which Permittee resides
 
ZIP:        Permitee's Zip code
 
WWTP:       The Waste Water Treatment Plant into which the Permittee discharges

CATEGORY:   The main industrial category under which the facility falls
 
EPACAT1:    USEPA Category under which the facility falls.  Not all Permittee's 
            fall under an EPA Category
 
SIU:        Significant Industrial User, an USEPA designation given a Permittee 
            depending on several criteria.  SIU = 1, Non SIU = 0, 
            EPA requires MCES to monitor and inspect each SIUs at least once 
            per year. 
 
SIC_CODE:   Standard Industrial Classification Code, the main SIC Code under 
            which the facility falls
 
REPT_FREQY: Number of times a Permittee submits an Industrial Discharge Report 
            to the MCES.  
            1 = Annual, 
            2 = Semi-Annual, 
            4 = Quarterly</eaover>
