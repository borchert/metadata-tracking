Thus, the data format is not entirely consistent with some of the other LiDAR data collected by the State of Minnesota. Specifically, the Stearns County collect required classification of only Bare Earth returns in the LiDAR LAS files, so there is no information on buildings, vegetation, or model key points.

Breaklines captured as part of this effort are also a bit different. In Stearns County, the breaklines are 3D Polyline features rather than 3D Polygon features. They also include road centerlines, stream courses and other features that are not part of the Statewide collect specifications.

The following data was delivered to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR): 

1. Bare Earth LAS files 
2. 1-foot DEMs 
3. Breaklines (edge of water, curb and centerlines) 

DNR staff created the two-foot contours.

This included:

Bare Earth LAS files
1-foot DEMs
Breaklines (edge of water, curb and centerlines)

LAS file processing:
Projected from Stearns county coordinates to UTM Zone 15.
Reformatted into 1/16 USGS 1:24,000-scale tiles.

Breakline Processing:
Breaklines were imported from DXF files into a single, merged dataset.
Breaklines were then projected from Stearns county coordinates to UTM Zone 15, NAD83 Datum.
Breakline Z Values were then scaled from feet to meters.

Terrain Processing:
An ESRI Terrain Dataset was then created using the Bare Earth Points from the projected LAS files and the projected and scaled breaklines. 

DEM Generation:
New DEMs were generated rather than projecting the existing DEMs because the DEM is already an interpolated product and projecting this data would result in additional interpolation. Projecting the discrete point data and recreating the DEMs using the breaklines to enforce hydro-flattening was done.

- DEM01 - was created from the Terrain dataset. Cellsize 1 and nearest neighbor options were used in the ArcGIS command and the extent was snapped to an integer meter grid.
- DEM01HS - Hillshade was created from DEM01 - Altitude 45, Azimuth 215.
- DEM03 - was created from the Terrain dataset. Cellsize 3 and nearest neighbor options were used in the ArcGIS command and the extent was snapped to the state 3-meter grid for consistency with other products.
- DEM03HS - Hillshade was created from DEM03 - Altitude 45, Azimuth 215.
- DEM03_aspect - Land Surface aspect was generated from DEM03.
- DEM03slope_degrees - Land Surface slope in degrees was generated from DEM03.
- DEM03slope_percent - land surface slope in percent was generated from DEM03.

DEM Processing:
DEMs were merged into a single county raster.
Raster was then projected to UTM Zone 15, NAD 83 Datum with a cell size of 1-meter using a bilinear interpolation (DEM01).
One-meter raster was then generalized to 3-meter cell size (DEM03).
Three-meter DEM was smoothed using a 3x3 mean filter to facilitate contouring.
2-foot contours were created from the smoothed 3-meter raster - the smoothed raster was deleted when complete.


Processing Summary:

1) LAS files were projected from county coordinates to UTM Zone 15, NAD83
2) LAS point Z values were scaled from feet to meters
3) LAS files were retiled into the state tile scheme (1/16 of a USGS 1:24,000 scale quadrangle)
4) Breakline features were merged together into a single feature class
5) Breakline features were projected from county coordinates to UTM Zone 15, NAD83
6) Breakline Z Values were scaled from feet to meters
7) LAS Bare Earth Points and breaklines were used to create a Terrain data type 
8) 1-meter DEM was derived from Terrain using nearest neighbor interpolation option (DEM01)
9) Hillshade was derived from 1-meter DEM Altitude 45, Azimuth 215 (DEM01HS)
10) 3-meter DEM was derived from Terrain using nearest neighbor interpolation option (DEM03)
11) Hillshade was derived from 3-meter DEM Altitude 45, Azimuth 215 (DEM03HS)
12) Aspect was derived from 3-meter DEM (DEM03ASPECT)
13) Slope in degrees was derived from 3-meter DEM (DEM03SLOPE_DEGREES)
14) Slope in percent was derived from 3-meter DEM (DEM03SLOPE_PERCENT)
15) DEM03 was smoothed using a 3x3 mean smoothing filter 
16) 2-foot contours were created from the smoothed 3-meter DEM

All DEMS are hydro-flattened and enforced using the breakline features.

All processing was done using ESRI ArcGIS V10 software and LP360 Extensions software by QCoherent.
