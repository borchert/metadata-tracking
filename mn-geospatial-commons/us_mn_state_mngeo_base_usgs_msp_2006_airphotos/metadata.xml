An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. 

[Note: this metadata record was reformatted at the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office from the record provided by USGS - several of the fields were changed to reflect MnGeo's seamless WMS data delivery]</abstract><purpose>The data depicts geographic features on the surface of the earth. It was created to provide easily accessible geospatial data which is readily available to enhance the capability of Federal, State, and local emergency responders, as well as plan for homeland security efforts. This data also supports The National Map. 

A digital orthoimage is a geometrically accurate photographic record of landscape conditions at the time of the corresponding aerial photography. As such, High Resolution Orthoimagery is useful for a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring, facility engineering/maintenance, city/county planning, property line review, etc. The digital orthoimage can be used alone or as a raster basemap for corresponding vector line mapping. The detailed focus of High Resolution Orthoimagery provides emergency responders critical information in determining the best evacuation routes, alternative routes and safe access to aid. High Resolution Orthoimagery assists law enforcement personnel in determining the best locations to place surveillance cameras in high-traffic urban areas and popular attractions. The data assists Federal, State and local emergency responders in planning for homeland security efforts. This data also supports The USGS Seamless system.</purpose><supplinf>Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota (Twin Cities metropolitan area)</supplinf></descript><browse><browsen>http://tdds.cr.usgs.gov/browse/ortho/15T/VK/15TVK395545_201203_0x3000m_CL_1.jpg</browsen></browse><timeperd><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>200604</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><current>Imagery was flown April 17 and 18, 2006.</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>Irregular</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-93.77</westbc><eastbc>-92.85</eastbc><northbc>45.38</northbc><southbc>44.62</southbc></bounding></spdom><useconst>None.

The estimated horizontal positional accuracy value for the dataset is 1.0 meters.

The horizontal positional accuracy and the assurance of that accuracy depend, in part, on the accuracy of the data inputs to the rectification process. The location of existing photoidentifiable ground control and aerotriangulation points were evaluated on the Geotiff image and compared with their ground values in order to determine an overall accuracy for each test block of orthoimages within the project. After image coordinate measurement was completed for each block, an RMSE for the diagonal error was calculated for the orthoimages within the block. This value is an estimate of the horizontal accuracy of the tile expressed in meters.

These images are derived by mosaicking multiple images to ensure complete coverage. Source imagery is cloud free. Photography was flown during leaf-off in deciduous vegetation regions.

Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching.</attraccr></attracc><lineage><procstep><procdesc>SOURCES

2. Aerotriangulation, Originator:  Aero-Metric, Inc.

Aerotriangulation provides the exterior orientation parameters (X, Y, Z, omega, phi, kappa) for input to the orthorectification process.

PROCESSING STEPS at Aero-Metric, Inc.

The rectification process requires, as input, a digital elevation model (DEM) gridded to user-specified bounds, a digital image file (PHOTO), and external orientation parameters for the aerial photograph which are typically derived from aerotriangulation (ATCONTROL).

Natural Color imagery was collected at a photo scale of 1:15000 and scanned at 18 microns to generate the raw raster scans. Airborne GPS positions were computed by Photo Science, Inc. and used as control in the aerotriangulation process. The scanned aerial images, airborne GPS data, ground check point data, and camera calibration data were used as inputs to the aerotriangulaton process. ISAT 04.05 was used to perform block adjustments and generate exterior orientation parameters for each photo. The external orientation parameters were used to provide the geospatial control each photograph during orthorectification. Vertical control for the orthorectification process was obtained from existing USGS Digitial Elevation Models (DEM). During the orthorectification process, elevation data were extracted and resampled to meet user-specified intervals and bounds.

The orthorectified imagery is resampled to a 0.3-meter ground resolution with a ground extent of 1500 meters by 1500 meters, without overlap. Each 1500-meter orthoimage was generated from a mosaic created from multiple photographs. Orthoproduction was performed using the Intergraph Ortho Pro 4.4.18. Seamlines were Manually Generated and tone balanced between frames prior to cutting out into 1500-meter products. The orthorectified imagery is georeferenced to UTM zone 16, NAD83, meters.

All orthoimages are individually inspected for content, misalignments along mosaic seamlines, and void areas. Source information was collected and verified manually during the production process.
