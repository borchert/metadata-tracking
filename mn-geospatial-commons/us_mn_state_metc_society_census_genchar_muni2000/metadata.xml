US Census 2000 Demographic Profiles: 100-percent and Sample Data 

A profile includes four tables that provide various demographic, social, economic, and housing characteristics for the United States, states, counties, minor civil divisions in selected states, places, metropolitan areas, American Indian and Alaska Native areas, Hawaiian home lands and congressional districts (106th Congress). It includes 100-percent and sample data from Census 2000. 

The Demographic Profile consists of four tables (DP-1 thru DP-4). For Census 2000 data, the DP-1 table is available as part of the Summary File 1 (SF 1) dataset, and the other three tables are available as part of the Summary File 3 (SF 3) dataset.
</abstract><purpose>This table can be joined to the Cities and Townships spatial dataset using the CTU_CODE field (5 digit FIPS Place code).  This will allow users to create maps and conduct spatial analyses with the data in this table.</purpose></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>2000</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><current>2000 U.S. Census</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>As needed</update></status><keywords><theme><themekt>None</themekt><themekey>demographics, society, Census, demographic profile</themekey></theme><place><placekey>Minnesota, Twin Cities</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>None</useconst><native>dBASE IV (DBF 4)</native><crossref><citeinfo><title>City and Township Boundaries - 2000</title></citeinfo></crossref><spdom><bounding><westbc>-97.23</westbc><eastbc>-89.53</eastbc><northbc>49.37</northbc><southbc>43.5</southbc></bounding></spdom><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntperp><cntorg>Metropolitan Council</cntorg><cntper>Tanya Mayer</cntper></cntperp><cntpos>GIS Coordinator</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype> mailing and physical address </addrtype><address>390 Robert Street North</address><city>St. Paul</city><state>Minnesota</state><postal>55101-1805</postal></cntaddr><cntvoice>651.602.1604</cntvoice><cntemail>tanya.mayer@metc.state.mn.us</cntemail></cntinfo></ptcontac></idinfo><dataqual><complete>Entire state of MN is covered.</complete></dataqual><spdoinfo><indspref>CTU_CODE:  5 digit FIPS Place code for cities and townships.</indspref><direct></direct><mgmg3obj></mgmg3obj><mgmg3til>One file for entire state of MN</mgmg3til></spdoinfo><eainfo><overview><eaover>CTU_CODE   5 digit FIPS 'Place' code, Census Bureau standard code and
