A principal goal of the Regional Planned Land Use dataset is to allow users to view, analyze and display planned land use data for anywhere in the seven county metropolitan area with a consistent land use classification scheme. The Metropolitan Council uses the Regional Planned Land Use (PLU) data to help monitor growth and plan for regional services such as regional parks, transit service, and wastewater collection and treatment. 

Although the planned land use data is based on the locally adopted land use plans and designations for each community, it represent only data that has been submitted to the Metropolitan Council for review per the Metropolitan Land Planning Act of 1995 (Minn. Stat 473.864, Subd 2 and 473.175, Subd 1). See Data Quality Information (Section 2 of this metadata) for specifics about the Metropolitan Land Planning Act of 1995 under Completeness information. 

Since there is no official State or Regional land use coding scheme that communities must conform with, the variability of content and codes between communities' land use plans is nearly as vast as the number of communities themselves (187). Differences among communities can range from the implementation of different land use categories to conflicting definitions of similar categories. The PLU dataset attempts to effectively level out the variability among communities by translating communities land use categories and descriptions into a common classification scheme developed and endorsed by MetroGIS (a regional GIS data sharing consortium) participants while retaining each communities' original categories. Although the comparability of land use plans between communities has greatly improved as a result of this translation or "regionalization" of communities' land use codes, it is possible that not all community land use definitions have been precisely translated into the most appropriate regional land use category. 

In conjunction with other regional information (i.e., land use trend data, households and jobs forecasts), the PLU data can help communities more easily understand regional and sub-regional planning goals and Council staff, working with individual local units of government, can better plan for the future needs and financing of regional services.

I. DATASET GOALS AND SUMMARY 
A principal goal of the Regional Planned Land Use (PLU) dataset is to allow users to view, analyze and display planned land use data for anywhere in the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area with a consistent land use classification scheme. In conjunction with other regional information (i.e., land use trend data, households and jobs forecasts), the PLU data can help communities more easily understand regional and sub-regional planning goals and Metropolitan Council staff, working with individual local units of government, can better monitor growth and plan for the future needs and financing of regional services such as regional parks, transit service, and wastewater collection and treatment. 

Since there is no official State or Regional land use coding scheme that communities must conform with, the variability of content and codes between communities' land use plans is nearly as vast as the number of communities themselves (187). Differences among communities can range from the implementation of different land use categories to conflicting definitions of similar categories. The PLU dataset attempts to effectively level out the variability among communities by translating communities land use categories and descriptions into a common classification scheme while retaining the communities' original categories. Although the comparability of land use plans between communities has greatly improved as a result of this translation or "regionalization" of communities' land use codes, it is likely that not all community land use definitions have been precisely translated into the most appropriate regional land use category (see "Summary of Regionalization Consistencies and Assumptions"). 


II. CREATION OFTHE PLANNED LAND USE (PLU) DATASET 

A. LAND USE CODING SCHEME: 
The PLU dataset came to fruition in 2002 based on an original "Information Need" outlined by MetroGIS and the Metropolitan Council's need to collect and compare communities' land use plans across jurisdictional boundaries for planning and servicing regional services (i.e., regional parks, transit, and waste collection and treatment). Derived from communities' individual land use plans and subsequent plan amendments, the data set is displayed utilizing a uniform classification scheme that incorporates the concepts and practices fostered by the American Planners Association. The classification scheme - the Regional Planned Land Use Coding Scheme - is the result of more than 3 Â½ years of collaboration between MetroGIS, the North Metro I-35W Corridor Coalition and the Metropolitan Council. The combined, uniform regional vision allows users to visualize information in a variety of ways and make "apples to apples" comparisons between communities which can influence regional and sub-regional planning policies in ways that hadn't been possible in the past. 

Based on the recommendation of MetroGIS, the classification scheme distinguishes between use and "intensity of use." To better explain this distinction, consider the following often-used land use terms: "Multifamily Residential" and "High Density Residential." Both terms are describing a form "Residential" land use. Whereas "Multifamily" defines the type residential land use, "High Density" is a qualitative term reflecting the intensity of use the "Residential" land. Such intensity descriptions are not reserved solely for residential land uses. Although not use as frequently, intensity qualifiers are just as applicable to other types of land use (i.e., "High Intensity Mixed Use", "Medium Performance Industrial" or "Low Density Business - Office Park"). Acknowledging that there is a distinction between a land use and the intensity of that use, an "Intensity of Use" Work Group was formed to refine the proposed Regional Land Use Coding Scheme land use categories and determine what "intensity" measures would be useful to supplement planned land use data, or more specifically, the Regional Coding Scheme. The Work Group outlined several measures but, only "Housing Density" was designated as a priority and addressed by the group as of 2002. As a result, "Housing Density" (i.e., "HSG_DEN") and "Housing Density Range" (i.e., "HSGDEN_RNG") are included as separate data fields in the Regional Planned Land Use dataset to record the community's known allowable housing density range associated with a residential land use category and which standardized density range category is most appropriate for the community's description, respectively (see Definition of the "Intensity of Use" Work Group's Housing Density Ranges list below). 

For more information about the activities and participants involved in the development of MetroGIS's Regional Planned Land Use Coding Scheme or data set, refer to www.metrogis.org/data/info_needs /planned_land_use/index.shtml. To view the land use categories of the Regional Planned Land Use Coding Scheme refer to Definition of Planned Land Use Categories listed below. 

B. GEOGRAPHY (SPATIAL BASE): 
Like all geographic data managed by the Metropolitan Council, a goal of the PLU data is to interoperable with other geographic data. As such, the PLU data is compiled and delineated using a topologically CLEANED spatial database comprising of county-produced city and township boundaries and parcel boundaries for the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area (i.e., Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, and Washington Counties), data made available through MetroGIS. As a result, where coterminous, the planned land use designations align with parcel (or property) boundaries. In areas where the planned land use boundaries do not follow parcel boundaries, parcels are split to approximately reflect the land use plan designations. 

Initially, land uses were delineated to parcel boundaries and non-parcels lands (lands not defined as a parcel such as road rights-of-way) were delineated and designated accordingly (i.e., Vehicular Rights-of-Way or Pedestrian Rights-of-Way, etc.). However, due to the structure of some county parcel datasets and the difficulties associated with maintaining the geographic integrity of the Regional Planned Land Use Dataset due to periodic parcel alignment adjustments by counties, the methodology was re-evaluated. When combined with the fact that the data capture methodology of the Council's 5-Year "Existing" land use inventories included land use delineation to rights-of-way centerline and users' desire to compare current land use patterns with planned development, a call to change the way rights-of-ways are classified in the PLU dataset was made. As a result, starting in 2005, only major highways are delineated and classified as "Vehicular Rights-of-Way" in the PLU dataset. The major highways are defined by the Metropolitan Council's Functional Roads classification. All other rights-of ways were delineated from the adjacent land use boundaries to the centerline, using The Lawrence Group (TLG) Street Centerlines as a guide, and assigned the appropriate land use designation. 

C. DATA CAPTURE METHODOLOGY: 
The following general data capture procedures (the translation or "regionalization" of community's land use categories) are used to create the PLU data set: 
1. Quarterly, gather all new community land use plans and plan amendments and incorporate their geography into the existing PLU dataset using current parcel boundaries to guide delineation - starting in 2005, incorporation means delineation to the rights-of-way centerline. 
2. Record communities' land use designations exactly as defined in their land use plans, 
3. Translate or "regionalize" communities' land use designations and housing densities into the detailed Regional Planned Land Use Coding Scheme and Housing Density Ranges through a "best-fit" procedure. See "Summary of Regionalization Consistencies and Assumptions" for more information about "best-fit" procedures. 
4. Dissolve or summarize the geography by land use types per community so that the final PLU dataset contains neither complete, original parcel boundaries nor any original parcel attribution (information) as specified in the current MetroGIS data-sharing agreement for the county parcel data. 
5. Upon completion of the the first version of the Regional PLU dataset (May 2002) and after a major significant data structural change (05/01/05), individual community information was mapped and sent to the communities for review and comments on accuracy of the Council's land use information and their regionalization of community designation into the Regional Planned Land Use Coding Scheme. NOTE: accuracies of the data and concerns regarding the regionalization of data will be continually addressed as they are presented. 

As land is developed and land use plans are "realized," frequently, development occurs with slightly different geography or alignment as speculatively depicted on the land use plan maps. Because of this reality, it was believed that an annual realignment of the preceding PLU data with actual parcel alignment would help achieve and maintain the goal of having geographically aligned regional datasets. To date, an automated, consistent annual realignment procedure has not been developed. As plan amendments are incorporated in the Regional dataset, realignment of previously incorporated planned land use may occur to improve the geographic representation of the data which, in turn, can alter the total land use area for a community's land use category beyond simple growth or land use change. Additionally, periodic review and realignments may occur when resources allow also impact land use area totals.
