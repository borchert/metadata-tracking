The geography for this file is based on the Twin Cities Regional Travel Demand Forecast Model. 

Notes: 

- Since 2004, this set of TAZs is the official TAZ system for travel demand modeling, socioeconomic forecasts and community comprehensive plan development, in addition to its existing use for the 2000 Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP).

- Population, households and employment forecasts by TAZ, published with this file during 2004-2013, have been replaced with newer forecasts adopted by Metropolitan Council, starting in May 2014. 

- This system is a modification of an earlier TAZ system developed by Minnesota Department of Transportation and Metropolitan Council in late 1989, referred to as Transportation Analysis Zones 1990 (TAZ1990). The principal difference between the 1990 and 2000 systems is that 27 TAZs were subdivided into smaller units, thus expanding the total number of TAZs from 1165 to 1201. 

- Generally, the 2000 TAZ system utilized TIGER line files for 2000 Census blocks and political boundaries, which do not necessarily match the positionally accurate street-line files and political boundaries typically used with other Council generated GIS datasets. </abstract><purpose>The transportation analysis zones layer was developed as a means to compile and analyze socioeconomic data and data related to transportation system capacity.

Generally came from Tiger data received in 1999.  Metropolitan Council projected to UTM, NAD83 Meters and combined counties. Then TAZ IDs  and attributes were added by Metropolitan Council staff. 


POPULATION AND EMPLOYMENT VALUES:

The year-2000 population and household data for each TAZ is aggregated from block level census data.  In most cases, census blocks fit neatly into each TAZ.  In the few cases where they did not, a determination was made as to the appropriate TAZ in which to include the block, based on the general location of population within the block.

Employment data for the year-2000 was received from the Minnesota Department of Economic Security MNDES.   MNDES provided the Metropolitan Council a file of employer address that the Metropolitan Council address matched and aggregated to each TAZ.  In a few cases, the employment numbers for a TAZ did not meet the discloser thresholds required by MNDES.  In such cases, the numbers were adjusted with a neighboring TAZ to prevent disclosure.  This was more common with retail employment numbers than with total employment.

The 2010 through 2030 population and employment data are based on city forecasts as of January 9, 2008.  Their distributions result from community Comprehensive Plan updates.TAZ GEOGRAPHY:

Employment data for 2000 and 2010 was received from Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (MN DEED).  MN DEED provideda file of employer addresses that the Metropolitan Council geocoded and summarized to TAZs.  In a few cases, the employment numbers for TAZs did not meet the disclosability thresholds required by MN DEED.  In such cases, affected TAZs were combined with neighboring TAZs and employment totals randomly re-allocated to avoid disclosure.
