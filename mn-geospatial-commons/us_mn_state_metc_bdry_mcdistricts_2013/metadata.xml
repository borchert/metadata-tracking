NOTES:
-  The current Metropolitan Council Districts were enacted in 2013.
-  Council member names and spellings are taken directly from the Metropolitan Council web site and press releases.
-  Hanover, New Prague, Northfield, and Rockford have been removed from the district boundaries.
-  Only the cities of Minneapolis, St. Paul and Eagan have significant populations split into more than one Council District.  Chanhassen, Hastings and Spring Lake Park have small areas accross county boundaries in another Council district.
- The actual descriptions of Metropolitan Council District boundaries were taken from Minnesota Statutes 2012, 473.123  http://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/stats/473/123.html
- Adjustments for district boundaries that fall on city/township boundaries are updated on a quarterly basis with data from counties.
-The 2013 plan files, details and components passed by the 2013 MN Legislature can be found at http://www.gis.leg.mn/html/redistricting.html
-For the map and data available from the Metropolitan Council, district boundaries were adjusted to conform to existing geography employed by the Metropolitan Council.</abstract><purpose>This layer was developed as a general reference for Metropolitan Council districts.</purpose><supplinf>Twin Cities 7 County Metropolitan Area.

The plan and district descriptions can be found at http://www.gis.leg.mn/html/redistricting.html.  For the map and data available from the Metropolitan Council, district boundaries were adjusted to conform to existing geography employed by the Metropolitan Council.

Most line work for the 'MetCouncilDistricts' layer was derived from the city and townships boundary layer assembled by the Metropolitan Council.  Additional lines were derived from NCompass Street Centerline data.  Where divided highways serve as the boundary between districts, the district border was digitized between the representative TLG centerlines.  Where divided by city or township boundary, the district border is based on the most current quarterly update of the city and township boundary layer.  Council Member names and spellings were taken directly from the Metropolitan Council web site and press releases.
