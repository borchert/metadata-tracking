It was produced at 1-foot (30 cm) resolution from new aerial photography captured in Spring 2010.

Funding for this data was provided by the Minnesota Natural Heritage Fund, the Minnesota Clean Water Legacy Act, The Environmental and Natural Resources Trust Fund, the Metropolitan Council, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the Metropolitan Mosquito Control District.

This metadata record was created by the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office (MnGeo) using information supplied by Surdex Corporation.</abstract><purpose>The orthophotos will be used by the Minnesota DNR to update the National Wetland Inventory maps and as a base layer for mapping wetlands and other business needs. This type of leaf-off photography is a critical component for a variety of land management applications including transportation planning, wetland mapping, urban planning, forest management, soil mapping, and utility siting.</purpose><supplinf>7-county Twin Cities metro: Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington counties, Minnesota</supplinf></descript><timeperd><current>Ground condition.

Cessna Conquests equipped with Intergraph DMC (Digital Mapping Cameras) captured 4 band imagery over the project sites. Imagery was captured at an altittude of 10,000 feet above mean terrain for most of the project area though some data was captured at 5,000 feet above mean terrain and resampled for multiple resolution delivery. Conditions allowed up 5% cloud conditions per frame. All four bands (RGB natural color plus near infrared) of raw camera data was processed using Intergraph PPS software coupled with Surdex proprietary image handling software for color correction and dodging. Post processing of Airborne and Ground GPS data was performed with Waypoint Consulting's GrafNav software. Aerial Triangulation was completed using Intergraph ImageStation Automatic Triangulation and rectification of imagery (to a variety of sources from 10m DEM to 3d stereo collection) was completed using Surdex proprietary software. Image mosaicking, QC and final DOQQ products were produced using proprietary Surdex software.</procdesc></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><indspref></indspref><direct>Raster</direct><mgmg3obj></mgmg3obj><mgmg3til></mgmg3til></spdoinfo><eainfo><overview><eaover>Imagery has 4 Bands with the order of Red, Green, Blue and Near Infrared</eaover></overview></eainfo><distinfo><resdesc>ecmn2010_doqq_1ft</resdesc><distliab>MnGeo's data disclaimer is online: http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/chouse/disclaimer.html</distliab><stdorder><digform><digtinfo><formname></formname><formvern></formvern><transize></transize></digtinfo></digform><ordering>These air photos are available via MnGeo's WMS service.
