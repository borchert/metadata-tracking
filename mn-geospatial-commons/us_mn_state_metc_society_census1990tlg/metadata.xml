This dataset is coincident with and developed using the TLG Street Centerline and Landmarks databases where 1990 block boundaries fall on those features.  For those block boundaries that are defined by features not included in TLG databases, TLG used other digital resources to generate these boundaries, such as orthophotography or additional features from city and county GIS databases.  TLG used it's best judgement to digitize block boundaries when the block boundaries followed nonvisible features or street extensions.

This is a MetroGIS Regionally Endorsed dataset.</abstract><purpose>The dataset was developed to have a 1990 census block database that is aligned to the TLG street centerlines and landmarks  files, for use in analysis which utilizes both the census data and TLG street centerlines/landmarks.  Blockgroup and tract datasets have been desolved from the block dataset.  Additionally, since TLG's street centerline dataset is aligned within county rights-of-way for these counties, this dataset allows for parcel based analysis as it may pertain to census blocks, block groups and tracts.

This dataset is a precursor to creating a 2000 census block dataset when the 2000 TIGER/Line files are released by the Census Bureau.</purpose><supplinf>Twin Cities 7 County Metropolitan Area.

Several small water blocks that have radically changed since the 1990 census are not included in this. Due to differences in accuracy and geographical representation,  there are 22 land Census blocks not included in this file (most of these are small islands) and 6 Census blocks assigned to more than 1 polygon.  For a more detailed list see the TLG90Miss-Dup-blks.xls file. Other than these cases, a one-to-one correspondence has been confirmed between this dataset and the 1990 census data.

For a complete description of Census Bureau block numbering, please reference the TIGER Technical Documentation (prior to 2000 TIGER) at www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger</attraccr></attracc><logic>Each county polygon file is topologically 'clean'.</logic><complete>Entire seven county Twin Cities metro area is covered.</complete><posacc><horizpa><horizpar>The positional accuracy of the dataset has not been tested under the National Standards for Spatial Data Accuracy.  

There are differing degrees of positional accuracy throughout the file. TLG adjusts the positional accuracy of the road boundary segments to available sources that are known to have a greater degree of accuracy than those used to generate the original data. However, in all cases (including instances where COGO line work has been the reference) TLG generalizes the  segments to at most 4 feet in order to greatly reduce the number of vertices.

Segments depicting road centerlines have been aligned or snapped to county provided COGO linework, Parcel data, street centerlines or right of ways. 

Where city boundaries are used as  block boundaries, TLG has used the 'Counties and Minor Civil Divisions, Twin Cities Metropolitan Area' coverage which was developed by  Metropolitan Council, Dakota, Hennepin, Scott &amp; Washington Counties and the Minnesota Dept. of Transportation, unless there were differences from the 1990 census files due to annexations occurring after the 1990 Census boundaries were defined -- in which case, the 1990 MCD boundaries from TIGER were followed.</horizpar></horizpa></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srcscale></srcscale></srcinfo><procstep><procdesc>The Lawrence Group, under contract with Metropolitan Council, created this 1990 Census Bureau block polygon dataset for the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area (Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington Counties).

After the data was received from TLG, Metropolitan Council GIS staff projected the coverages in to the current projection, added/standardized the attribute items, and created final shapefiles.
