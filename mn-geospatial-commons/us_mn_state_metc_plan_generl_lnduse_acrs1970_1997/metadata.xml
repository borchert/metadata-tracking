      <abstract>The Generalized Land Use Acreage Totals 1970 - 1997 database is a tabular data file.  It is NOT A GIS LAYER.  The table contains acreage totals by municipality for the years of 1970, 1975, 1980, 1984, 1990 &amp; 1997.  

The acreage totals are given by County-MCD.  County-MCD (field name ''COMCD'') is defined as the portion of a Minor Civil Division (municipality) that resides within a county.  Most, but not all MCDs reside entirely within one county. 

Totals are also provided for acres inside and outside the Metropolitan Urban Service Area (MUSA) for certain categories in 1990 and 1997.

The acreage totals for 1984, 1990 &amp; 1997 were derived from the Generalized Land Use - Historical GIS layer.  See the metadata for that layer for an explanation of the methodology and procedures used to create it.

In general, this dataset contains the categories of: single-family residential, multi-family residential, commercial, industrial, public/semi-public, airports, parks &amp; recreation, vacant/agricultural, highways, open water bodies, farm homesteads, industrial parks not developed, and public land not developed.  In 1997 the classes of Extractive and Public Industrial were added.

NOTES:
- Prior to 1984, very little information exists to document the methods used to calculate the land use acreage totals.
- The municipal boundaries information used for acreage calculations has changed over the years.  Some of this change reflects actual changes in corporate boundaries, other changes reflect new depictions of the same municipal boundaries.
- Categories used for summarizing land use acreage as well as the definitions of those categories have not remained completely consistent over time.
- Acreage totals are thought to get less accurate as they get older.
- Many problems have been found in the 1984 data and many more are likely to exist.
- The 1990 data uses a 2000 MUSA as defined in 1990 while the 1997 data MUSA definition is as of October of 1998.</abstract>
      <purpose>To aid in forecasting region-wide land supply and demand and to be used as a general regional planning tool.  This data does not indicate developability of land, but does include acres of 'Vacant and Agricultural' lands based on the definition described in Section 5 of this metadata.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Twin Cities 7 County Metropolitan Area.  This includes the counties of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington in Minnesota.</supplinf>

A note about MUSA calculations:  
Land use data is also provided for the Council's Metropolitan Urban Service Area (MUSA) for 1990 and 1997. The MUSA is an area defined by the Metropolitan Council where urban services are being planned to accommodate development up to a future point in time. For both the 1990 and 1997 land use data, a 2000 MUSA line is used. But this is not the same line because the MUSA line is adjusted over time to reflect more specific development proposals, as well as, development that has actually occurred. Areas may be added or subtracted from the MUSA, affecting both city level and regional MUSA figures. The 1990 data uses a 2000 MUSA as defined in 1990 while the 1997 data MUSA definition is as of October of 1998.</procdesc>

      <eadetcit>The original categories used for land use breakdowns were established in 1962 and have been modified slightly over the years.  The classes for the 1997 land use layer are as follows:

1 - Single Family Residential
Includes all individual, free standing single family housing (including manufactured housing).  Within the MUSA (metropolitan urban service area) and in residential developments outside the MUSA, the lot lines visible on the photos were used for determining residential land use boundaries.  Where residential developments were visibly not complete, the undeveloped area was classified as vacant.  For the scattered, rural residential areas outside the MUSA, only the portion of lots used for residences was assigned to the residential category.

2 - Multi-Family Residential
Includes all multiple dwelling units such as duplexes, bungalows, twin homes, townhouses, quad homes and apartment complexes.  Also, buildings that are primarily apartments that have some group dining facilities are included (however, not those buildings that fit the census definition of 'Group Quarters', such as, dormitories, nursing homes or medical care facilities).

3 - Commercial
Includes all retail sales, services, hotels and motels, health care facilities (e.g. medical and dental clinics and offices and medical laboratories, but not hospitals and nursing homes) and recreational services that are predominantly privately owned and operated for profit (e.g. theaters, bowling alleys, equestrian ranches) except golf courses.  Hospitals and nursing homes are included in the 'Public &amp; Semi-Public' category and golf courses are in the 'Parks &amp; Recreation Areas' class.  For large shopping centers, only actual developed areas are shown.  This is done so that over the years new development can be shown (e.g. restaurants or gas stations on perimeter roads).

4 - Industrial
Includes the Federal Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes 14 through 50.  This includes manufacturing, transportation, construction, communications, utilities, and wholesale trade.  Also included in the 'Industrial' category are some horticultural specialty land uses (e.g. large greenhouses that do not sell to the public).  As of 1997, gravel pits and quarrying have been placed in a new category called 'Extractive' and all publicly owned areas that are predominantly of industrial nature have been placed in a new category called 'Public Industrial.'

5 - Public Semi-Public
Includes the land under and adjacent to schools (public and private), hospitals, churches, cemeteries, ice arenas and all facilities of local, state and federal governments, including convalescent homes, mental institutions and penal facilities maintained by any level of government.  All lands within the boundaries of these institutions and facilities are included in this category.  However, in certain instances unused lands were included in the 'Public &amp; Semi-Public Vacant' category (e.g. the University of Minnesota's property in Rosemount, or part of the land adjacent to the Minnesota Veterans Home in Hastings).

6 - Airports
All types of airports.

7 - Parks &amp; Recreation Areas
Includes all parks (city, regional and state), wildlife refuges, playgrounds, zoos, gun clubs, golf courses and similar areas (this includes DNR wildlife management areas and scientific and natural areas).  Parks are delineated using their actual boundaries taken directly off comprehensive plans, park maps or county parcel data.

8 - Vacant/Agricultural
Includes land identifiable from aerial photos as open and in agriculture uses, other uses where no buildings are present or unused land.  Please note that indoor horticultural specialty land uses (the growing of nursery stock, flowers, seeds, sod and food crops in large greenhouses that do not sell to the public; and large concentrations of agricultural buildings (e.g., barns, sheds and silos)) are included in the 'Industrial' category where they can be delineated.  Where residential uses are on larger lots, the residential land use category my include only the house and mowed portion of the parcel, with the rest being placed in this Vacant and Agricultural category.

9 - Major Four Lane Highways
Includes only the major interstate freeways and 4 lane divided highways with rights-of-way of 200 feet or greater.  Also included in 1997 are all 4-lane roads with a Metropolitan Council functional class designation of 'Principal Arterial.'

10 - Open Water Bodies
Includes lakes larger than 5 acres and rivers wider than 200 feet.

11 - Farmsteads
Includes only that portion of land that encompasses the buildings on the farmstead.

12 - Extractive
New category in 1997.  Includes all gravel pits and quarries.

41 - Industrial Parks not Developed
Parcels of land in a designated (named) industrial park but not developed.

51 - Public &amp; Semi-Public Vacant
A government or university owned parcel of land that is undeveloped (e.g. part of arsenal site in Arden Hills or the University property in Rosemount).

54 - Public Industrial
New category in 1997.  Includes all publicly owned areas that are predominantly of an industrial nature (e.g. waste water treatment plants, city bus garages, and Dept. of Transportation sand and salt stockpiling areas).  In the past, some of these have been coded as industrial and others as public.</eadetcit>
