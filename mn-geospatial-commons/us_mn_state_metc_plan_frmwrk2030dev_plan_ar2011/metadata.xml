This dataset reflect the agreed upon planning areas between a community and the Metropolitan Council and defined in the communities' 2030 Comprehensive Plan Update and is intended to supplement the 2030 Regional Development Framework - the planning guide for the 7-county Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minnesota. 

Planning area definitions and strategies for the planning areas are available in the 2030 Regional Development Framework document at http://www.metrocouncil.org/Planning/Planning/2030-Regional-Development-Framework.aspx  (See Chapter 3). For questions about how decisions were made regarding individual communities' geographic planning areas, please contact the Metropolitan Council Regional Framework Development staff, Dan Marckel, 651-602-1548.

They have subsequently been used for a wide range of general analysis purposes.  These areas were defined to reflect stages of development of metropolitan area communities.  A major factor in their determination has been the proportion of land developed.  As such, these areas have been periodically adjusted to reflect the continued outward growth of the region. The Metropolitan Council originally approval the 2030 Planning Areas on January 14, 2004. The planning areas were amended on December 13, 2006.  The dataset reflects updates to the 2030 Planning Areas as specified in communities' 2008 Comprehensive Plans which have received Metropolitan Council approval between 2006 and February 2013. Not all communities have finalized their 2008 Comprehensive Plans as of May 2014. Planning Areas reflect municipal boundaries and Metropolitan Urban Service Areas (MUSA) as of May 22 2014. </current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>As needed</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-94.012</westbc><eastbc>-92.732</eastbc><northbc>45.415</northbc><southbc>44.471</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>None</themekt><themekey>planning and development, 2030 Framework Planning Areas, 2030 Framework, regional growth strategy</themekey></theme><place><placekey>Twin Cities, Anoka County, Carver County, Dakota County, Hennepin County, Ramsey County, Scott County, Washington County</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>None</useconst><browse><browsen>ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/plan_frmwrk2030dev_plan_ar2011/metadata/preview.jpg</browsen><browsed>Sample map showing the 2030 framework planning areas layer.</browsed></browse><native>ArcView 9.3</native><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntperp><cntorg>Metropolitan Council</cntorg><cntper>Paul Hanson</cntper></cntperp><cntpos>GIS Coordinator - Community Development</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype> mailing and physical address </addrtype><address>390 Robert Street North</address><city>St. Paul</city><state>Minnesota</state><postal>55101-1805</postal></cntaddr><cntvoice>651.602.1642</cntvoice><cntfax>651.602.1674</cntfax><cntemail>paul.hanson@metc.state.mn.us</cntemail></cntinfo></ptcontac></idinfo><dataqual><logic>The dataset is topologically 'clean'.</logic><complete>Entire seven county geographic area is covered.</complete><lineage><srcinfo><srcscale></srcscale></srcinfo><procstep><procdesc>The 2030 Regional Development Framework Planning Areas were initially adopted on January 14, 2004. Six planning areas make up the 2030 Regional Development Framework Planning Areas - Developed Areas, Developing Areas, Rural Centers, Diversidied Rural Areas, Rural Residential Areas, and Agricultural Areas. The Planning Areas were ammended in 2006 to include a new planning area designation - Rural Growth Centers - for the City of East Bethel. 

In January 2007, Lake Elmo's Comprehensive Plan was finalized. The data and maps were updated in 2010.

Starting in 2006, communities began adopting their 2030 Comprehensive Plan Updates. Through these updates, based on a community's recent growth, desire for future grow, or existing development pattern, communities could request a change in their planning area designation. All changes in planning area designations were agreed upon by the community and the Metropolitan Council. Most designation changes occurred between Developing Areas to Developed Areas, Rural Centers to Rural Growth Centers, and Diversified Rural to Rural Residential. 

This dataset (2030 Regional Development Framework Planning Areas - 2011) reflects the 2030 Planning Areas as agreed upon between the community and the Metropolitan Council derived from the 2030 Comprehensive Plan Updates.  

Sources data used to define the 2030 Regional Development Framework Planning Areas - 2011 includes:
- 2010 Municipal Boundaries
- 2010 County parcel data
- Communities Planned Land Use data from their Comprehensive Plan Update
- Metropolitan Urban Service Area (MUSA)

The dataset also contains a planning area category for four communities within the 7-county Twni Cities metropolitan area not under the Metropolitan Council planning jurisdiction (Hanover, New Prague, Northfield, and Rockford) 

Planning Area Definitions and Strategies for Geographic Planning Areas are available in the 2030 Regional Development Framework document at http://www.metrocouncil.org/planning/framework/overview.htm  (See Chapter 3).

With a growing need to have current geographic information, the 2030 Regional Development Framework Planning Areas - 2011 dataset will be updated on a quarterly basis to reflect changes in municipal or Metropolitan Urban Service Area (MUSA) boundaries.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Source data used to define the Geographic Planning Areas of the Growth Strategy
- 2000 Municipal Boundaries
- 2000 Generalized Land Use
- Comprehensive Plan Composite data from early in 2002 (communities that had not completed their comprehensive plan review process included Rockford, Minnetonka Beach, Shorewood, Eden Prairie, Jordan, Ham Lake, Linwood Twp., Lake Elmo, St. Mary's Point, New Market and Elko)

Many boundaries from the Comprehensive Plan Composite data were generalized to portray a more general growth strategy policy. 

The 640 polygons in the approved dataset were dissolved into the 6 Geographic Planning Areas plus a category for the 4 metro communities not under Council jurisdiction (Northfield, New Prague, Hanover and Rockford)

The 6 planning areas are further broken down to either Urban or Rural planning areas.  In the Urban Planning area are the Developing and Developed areas.  In the Rural Planning area are the Rural Center, Agricultural, Diversified Rural and Rural Residential areas.  

Several sliver polygons can be seen on screen at the metro scale but 'disappear' when zoomed in to a closer range.  Slivers are not visible when printed on 36x36 inch map or at other map sizes.


The Regional Growth Strategy (titled 2030 Framework Planning Areas) that was adopted on January 14, 2004 was a map that also included:
- Regional Natural Resource Areas (including Terrestrial and Wetland Areas) from the Metro DNR in coordination with the Metropolitan Council (Preliminary Regionally Significant Natural Resources Areas)
- Regional Parks (Regional Recreation Open Space Features)
- 2 proposed Regional Parks (Metropolitan Council Parks and Recreation staff)
- Existing, Planned and Proposed Regional and State Trails (Park Operating Agencies) 
- Transit 2025 Corridor (Transitways on Dedicated Rights-of-Way, 2025 dataset)
- Principal Arterials (Functional Class Roads and Proposed Functional Class Roads, 2002, Principal Arterials only)
