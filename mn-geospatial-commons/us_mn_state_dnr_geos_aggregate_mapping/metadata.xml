      <abstract>The Aggregate Resource Mapping Program (ARMP) began in 1984 when the Minnesota Legislature passed a law (Minnnesota Statutes, section 84.94) to: 
- Identify and classify aggregate resources outside of the Twin Cities metropolitan area; 
- Give aggregate resource information to local units of government and others for making comprehensive land-use and zoning plans; 
- Introduce aggregate resource protection; and Promote orderly and environmentally sound development of the resource.

Provided here is a compilation of GIS data produced by the DNR's Aggregate Resource Mapping Program.  Also provided is the aggregate resource GIS data from the 7-County Metropolitan Area mapped by the Minnesota Geological Survey (MGS). Please see the layer-specific metadata for each of the 9 layers for more details:

      <procstep>This varies since the data is a compilation of gravel pits, sand pits, borrow pits, quarries, and prospects collected between 1987-2013. Please consult the original project metadata found at the Aggregate Mapping Program's completed project page at: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lands_minerals/aggregate_maps/completed/index.html  

Generally speaking, these data points were captured from several different digital GIS data sources at the time of mapping, including USGS 1:24000 quadrangles, 1:12000 USGS DOQs (from 1991), Farm Service Agency (FSA) color air photos (from 2003-04, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010), Natural Resource Conservation Service Soil Survey point data, and the ASIS (Aggregate Source Information System) dataset from the Minnesota Department of Transportation. 

For counties completed after 2006 the points were edited in the field with a GPS (+/- 3 Meters), tablet PC, and ArcGIS Desktop. For counties completed prior to 2006 points were penciled in on printed USGS 1:24,000 quadrangle maps and later digitized on screen using GIS software.</procstep>
