ID_NO: Name of interceptor
 
SYMBOL: Symbol for the type of interceptor pipe
* 1 = Gravity: Flow is moved by gravity, based on the slope of the pipe. 
* 2 = Forcemain: Pressurized sewer pipe - requires pumps to push flow until it can move by gravity again.
* 3 = Siphon: A pipe designed to go under obstacles such as rivers. The entry point is higher than the exit, creating pressure that pushes the material through the pipe.
* 4 = Outfall/Effluent: Pipe which transports treated effluent from the treatment plant to the outfall or discharge point. 
* 5 = Low-head Crossing: A pipe designed to go under smaller obstacles, such as creeks. 
* 6 = Misc. pipe: Wide variety of sewer and non-sewer features. Can include city sewer pipe which connects remote MCES features, Access tunnels, MCES Air pipes, and more. (data not included in "Limited Attributes" dataset)
* 8 = Crossover: General category for pipes intentionally designed to divert flow; often controlled by valve features but not always. Can include pipes which bypass meter sites, crossover pipes which connect two barrels of a forcemain, and more.
 
Int_Sect: Unique identifier for individual sections of the interceptor. 

DIMEN: Diameter/Dimension of pipe if circular

Status: Status of interceptor pipe
* Abandoned = existing pipe has been abandoned
* Offline = existing pipe is not active
* Online = existing pipe is active and under use

created_user: Editor tracking attribute. Indicates which GIS user created the record.

created_date: Editor tracking attribute. Indicates when the record was created. 

last_edited_user: Editor tracking attribute. Indicates which GIS user last edited the record.

last_edited_date: Editor tracking attribute. Indicates when the record was last edited.
