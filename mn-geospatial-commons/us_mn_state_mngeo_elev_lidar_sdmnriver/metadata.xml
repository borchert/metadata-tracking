      <abstract>The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources contracted with Sanborn Map Co., Inc. to provide Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) mapping services for the South Dakota portion of the Minnesota River Basin. Utilizing multi-return systems, LiDAR data in the form of 3-dimensional positions of a dense set of mass points was collected for approximately 1,946 square miles.

The vendor delivered the data to the DNR in several formats:

1) One-meter digital elevation model
2) Edge-of-water breaklines
3) Classified LAS formatted point cloud data

DNR staff created three additional products: two-foot contours, building outlines and hillshades.

The data are in UTM Zone 14 coordinates.

Note: This metadata record was created at the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office by combining information supplied by Sanborn and the DNR.</abstract>
      <purpose>This LIDAR operation was designed to provide a high density set of masspoints within the defined areas. The data sets are suitable for the development of contours for use in hydraulic/hydrologic model development, and for assessing environmental impacts.Typical uses for the data set include: FEMA Flood Plain Map Modernization. DFIRM map updates. Watersheds and other hydro studies per FEMA specifications. County Mapping projects which include several uses, in addition to Flood mitigation assessment. Mapping projects that include accuracy verification, reporting and meta data.</purpose>

        <procdesc>SANBORN PROCESSING INFORMATION

Data Collection:
Using a Leica Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) system, 135 flight lines of standard density (1.4 meter ground sample distance) data were collected over areas in South Dakota, (approximately 1,946 square miles). Multiple returns were recorded for each laser pulse along with an intensity value for each return. The data acquisition occurred in 11 missions between November 02, 2010, and November 08, 2010. During the LIDAR campaign, the field crew conducted a GPS field survey to establish final coordinates of the ground base stations for final processing of the base-remote GPS solutions.

Airborne GPS Processing:
Airborne GPS data was differentially processed and integrated with the post processed IMU data to derive a Smoothed Best Estimate of Trajectory (SBET). The SBET was used to reduce the LiDAR slant range measurements to a raw reflective surface for each flight line. The overlap between flight lines was removed to provide a homogeneous coverage, and the coverage was classified to extract a bare earth digital elevation model (DEM). Airborne GPS is differentially processed using the GrafNAV V7.50 software by Waypoint Consulting of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The PDOP and distance separation is as follows: The classification and quality control (QC) of LiDAR data is carried out using TerraScan software by Terrasolid Limited of Helinski, Finland.

IMU data Processing:
IMU data provides information concerning roll, pitch and yaw of collection platform during collection event. IMU information allows the pulse vector to be properly placed in 3D space allowing the distance from the aircraft reference point to be properly positioned on the elevation model surface. The IMU data is processed using the PosPac V4.2 software by Applanix Corporation of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada. The reflective surface is derived using the ALS Post Processor software by Leica Geosystems GIS &amp; Mapping Division of Atlanta, Georgia.

LIDAR Point Classification:
The classification and quality control (QC) of LiDAR data is carried out using TerraScan software by Terrasolid Limited of Helinski, Finland.

DEMs created from Bare Earth (ground only) LiDAR points.

Sanborn's final project report summarizes the methods used to establish the base station coordinate check, perform the LiDAR data collection and post-processing as well as the results of these methods.

DNR PROCESSING INFORMATION

Additional products generated by Minnesota DNR staff are in the geodatabase for each of the tiles:

1. Two-foot contours were created by resampling the 1-meter DEM to 3 meters, then smoothing the 3-meter grid using a neighborhood average routine, and then creating contours from this surface using standard ArcGIS processing tools.

2. Building outlines were created by extracting from the LAS files those points with Classification 6 (buildings), then grouping those points within 3 meters of each other into a single cluster and then creating an outline around those points. This was done using standard ArcMap tools.

3. Hillshades were created from the one- and three-meter DEMs using standard ArcMap tools. Azimuth value = 215, Altitude = 45, Z-Factor = 1 


NOTE ON COORDINATES:
- These tiles are wholly in South Dakota and so are in UTM Zone 14.
- Tiles from the adjoining Minnesota River Acquisition in Minnesota ( http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/chouse/metadata/lidar_swmn2010.html ) are in UTM Zone 15. This includes all of the tiles that intersect the Minnesota/South Dakota border.
