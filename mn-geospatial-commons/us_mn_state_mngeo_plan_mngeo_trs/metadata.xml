Beginning in the late 1840s, the federal government began surveying Minnesota as part of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS). The resulting network of land survey lines divided the state into townships, ranges, sections, quarter sections, quarter-quarter sections and government lots, and laid the groundwork for contemporary land ownership patterns. 

The township, range and section boundaries were digitized at MnGeo (formerly known as the Land Management Information Center - LMIC) from stable base mylars of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 30-minute latitude by 60-minute longitude map series (1:100,000-scale). All survey lines were extended across water bodies despite the fact that U.S. Geological Survey base maps depict them only on land. This addition allows all sections and townships to be represented as closed areas (polygons) ensuring that township and range location can be determined for any point in the state.  It also means that the data set is not affected if lake levels change over time.</abstract><purpose>Many irregularities occur when the theory of the PLSS is applied to land surveys on the ground. However, the PLSS acts today as the structure around which all legal descriptions of land parcels in Minnesota are based. It is, therefore, an important framework for most geographic investigations that require information about land ownership. PLSS information is intended to be used for regional studies conducted at the county or multi-county level. The section lines are not meant to be used as legal records.</purpose><supplinf>State of Minnesota</supplinf></descript><timeperd><current>The source for this data set is the USGS 30-minute latitude by 60-minute longitude map series (1:100,000-scale).

1.  Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) BaseMap
This interactive web map includes Public Land Survey (PLS) boundaries along with Transportation, Water and Imagery layers. See: http://dotapp7.dot.state.mn.us/website/mndot-basemap/viewer.htm

2.  SECTIC-24K:  Section Corner Database
SECTIC-24K is a digital file of the PLS section corners of Minnesota from the U.S. Geological Survey's 1:24,000-scale quadrangle maps. Also included are software utilities that: 1. provide user-specified section corner extraction from the SECTIC-24K database by county, quadrangle or township, 2. convert among PLSS, UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) and latitude/longitude coordinates, and between NAD27 and NAD83 datum values, and 3. create user-defined output files in dBASE format. See: http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/chouse/metadata/sectic.html

3.  Section-level Public Land Survey
This file was derived from SECTIC24K section corner data, using a routine which inserts line segments between point section corners. See http://deli.dnr.state.mn.us/metadata/pls_sectpy3.html


Quarter-quarter section level data sets:

1.  Control Point Generated PLS
This 1:24,000-scale quarter-quarter section and government lot data set was constructed using section corner coordinates from the Control Point Inventory as well as information from the original General Land Office surveyors' notes and plat maps. Note: the PLS lines do not cross water bodies. See http://deli.dnr.state.mn.us/metadata/pls_fortypy3.html

2.  TRSQ (Township, Range, Section, Quarter-quarter)
This data set contains Minnesota county, township, range, and section boundaries digitized from USGS 1:100,000-scale maps. Quarter-section and quarter-quarter section subdivisions were calculated.

The following evaluation was submitted to MnGeo on September 1, 1993 in a letter from Mapping Center Chief Merle E. Southern:  'The positional accuracy of the Minnesota LMIC [now MnGeo] PLSS data evaluated met most of our recently adopted acceptance/rejection criteria.  Tests of three thirty-minute segments all showed standard errors for x and y to be 5-mils [0.005 inch] or less.  Tracking test on two segments were generally acceptable -- one line was encountered that was 12-mils off.  No deviations of more than 11-mils are allowed.

MnGeo used the following procedure:

1. Section lines were digitized from USGS 1:100,000 stable base mylar maps for the 71 30-by-60-minute quadrangles that cover the state of Minnesota. Maps were registered using the 30' x 60' quadrangle corners. The Root Mean Square (RMS) error was less than .004 using the tolerance command with a tic match of 6 meters. Maps are all in the NAD27 datum.

2. Checkplots were made at a scale of 1:100,000.  Lines were reviewed using visual editing to ensure that the checkplot and mylar lines were within a line width of each other.

3. Each section polygon was labeled with its county, township, range, direction (east or west), and section (CTRS) identification.

4. Another 1:100,000-scale checkplot was made and the CTRS polygon codes were reviewed and corrected as needed.

5. Section corner tics were added by snapping the 1:24,000-scale tics from the Control Point Inventory to the intersection of the TRS digitized section lines.

6. A final 1:100,000-scale color plot was produced and reviewed, and corrections were made as needed.

7. Several statewide files were created from the 30' x 60' tiles by dissolving on each of the CTRS items in succession.  The resulting files contained CTRS, CTR (County, Township and Range), county boundaries, and state boundary. The statewide files were reviewed for errors during the dissolve process and then by running frequencies and by visually reviewing on screen.

8. Files were converted to the NAD83 datum.

9. A series of related files were generated by county:  TRS, TR (Township and Range), and county boundary.</procdesc></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><indspref>None</indspref><direct>Vector</direct><mgmg3obj>Arc, Polygon, Node, Label Point</mgmg3obj><mgmg3til>Statewide, county, and 30' x 60' geographic areas corresponding to the USGS 1:100,000-scale base map series coverage.</mgmg3til></spdoinfo><spref><vertdef><altsys><altdatum>Not applicable</altdatum><altunits>Not applicable</altunits></altsys><depthsys><depthdn>Not applicable</depthdn><depthdu>Not applicable</depthdu></depthsys></vertdef><horizsys><planar><gridsys><gridsysn>Universal Transverse Mercator</gridsysn><utm><utmzone>15</utmzone></utm></gridsys><planci><plandu>meters</plandu></planci></planar><geodetic><horizdn>NAD83</horizdn><ellips>GRS80</ellips></geodetic></horizsys></spref><eainfo><overview><eaover>The Public Land Survey System features described in this data set are represented as attributed polygons and label points.

8.  ACRES:  area in acres calculated from the data set for each PLSS subdivision. This value represents a calculated value from the digital data set. It DOES NOT represent the results of a land survey.

9.  CTRS:  Combination of attributes 1, 3 - 6, showing County, Township, Range, Direction and Section.

10.  TRS:  Combination of attributes 3 - 6, showing Township, Range, Direction and Section.
