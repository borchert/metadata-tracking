The update is being conducted in geographic phases with data released for each region as it is finalized. This metadata record covers the first two geographic regions; east-central and southern Minnesota. Major funding was provided by the Environmental and Natural Resources Trust Fund. The updated NWI classify wetlands according to the system developed by Cowardin et al. (1979). The data also contains a simplified plant community classification (SPCC) and a simplified hydrogemorphic (HGM) classification. Quality assurance of the data included visual inspection, automated checks for attribute validity and topologic consistency, as well as a formal accuracy assessment based on an independent field verified data set. Further details on the methods employed can be found in the technical procedures document for this project located on the project website (http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/eco/wetlands/nwi_proj.html). The updated NWI data are primarily based on spring aerial imagery acquired in 2011 and lidar elevation data as well as other modern ancillary data. These data are intended to replace the original 1980s NWI data. NWI data support effective wetland management, protection, and restoration. The data provide a baseline for assessing the effectiveness of wetland policies and management actions. These data are used at all levels of government, as well as by private industry and non-profit organizations for wetland regulation and management, land use and conservation planning, environmental impact assessment, and natural resource inventories.
            
            EAST-CENTRAL: Operational support for wetland mapping and classification was provided by Ducks Unlimited (DU) and support for methods development and field validation were provided by the Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis Laboratory at the University of Minnesota. The DNR Resource Assessment Office provided additional support data processing, field checking, and quality control review. The east-central project area consists of 13 counties including: Anoka, Carver, Chisago, Dakota, Goodhue, Hennepin, Isanti, Ramsey, Rice, Scott, Sherburne, Washington, and Wright Counties. The updated wetland inventory area included complete coverage for all USGS quarter quadrangles that intersect any of these counties (about 7,150 square mile).The NWI classification process for east-central Minnesota consisted of three basic steps: 1) creation of image segments (polygons), 2) RandomForest classification of the segments, and 3) photo-interpretation/editing of the classified image segments.
            
            SOUTHERN: Operational support for wetland mapping and classification was provided by Geospatial Services of St. Mary's University of Minnesota (SMUMN) and support for methods development and field validation were provided by the Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis Laboratory at the University of Minnesota. The MNDNR Resource Assessment Office provided additional support data processing, field checking, and quality control review. Major funding was provided by the Environmental and Natural Resources Trust Fund. The project area consists of 36 counties in southern Minnesota including: Big Stone, Blue Earth, Brown, Chippewa, Cottonwood, Dodge, Faribault, Fillmore, Freeborn, Houston, Jackson, Kandiyohi, Lac qui Parle, Le Sueur, Lincoln, Lyon, Martin, McLeod, Meeker, Mower, Murray, Nicollet, Nobles, Olmstead, Pipestone, Redwood, Renville, Rock, Sibley, Steele, Swift, Wabasha, Waseca, Watonwan, Winona, and Yellow Medicine. The project encompasses 1,787 USGS quarter quads convering an area of 23,900 square miles (28% of the state). The NWI classification process for southern Minnesota relied on visual image interpretation and other geospatial techniques to identify and classify wetlands using remote sensing data. 

            NOTE: The layer files for this data have been set up to restrict drawing of the data when zoomed out beyond 1:100,000 scale for the east-central region and when zoomed out beyond 1:250,000 scale for the southern region. This is, in part, to prevent problems with slow perfomance with this large dataset. However, the data have also been compressed to speed the drawing performance and this results in a terminal system instability in ArcMap version 10.2 when the east-central data are viewed zoomed out beyond about 1:100,000 scale (1:60,000 scale for the Cowardin symbolized layer). This does not affect the more recent versions of ArcMap such as ArcMap 10.2.2. It also does not affect uncompressed versions of the data.</abstract><purpose>The updated NWI data for east-central and southern MN are primarily based on spring aerial imagery acquired in 2010 and 2011 and lidar elevation data as well as other modern ancillary data.

            1) EAST-CENTRAL ACCURACY TESTING
            
            PHOTOINTERPRETATION ACCURACY
            
            To assess the performance of the final deliverable provided by Ducks Unlimited with respect to the FGDC accuracy goals, the data were compared to an independently developed set of 901 photo-interpreted points (PI points). The points were selected by a stratified-random sampling process and classified using high-resolution stereo imagery (mostly 1-foot resolution), 3-meter LiDAR derived digital elevation models, and other ancillary data. The mapped wetland class (polygons) was associated with the validation class (points) using a spatial join process in ArcGIS. The distance to the nearest wetland-upland boundary was calculated for each point. Points inside of the 95% confidence interval of the positional uncertainty of the imagery were excluded from analysis (1.53 meters).
            
            The data were compared at two classification levels: level one compares the level of agreement between the two data sets for a two-class system of wetland versus upland, and level two compares the agreement between the data sets for the Cowardin wetland class-level. The producer's accuracy, the user's accuracy, and the overall accuracy were calculated for the level one (wetland-upland) classification. The level-two (Cowardin class) assessment calculated the overall accuracy.
            
            Wetland-Upland Accuracy
            Wetland Producer's Accuracy = 93%
            Wetland User's Accuracy = 98%
            Overall Wetland-Upland Accuracy = 93%
            
            Wetland Class Accuracy
            Overall Class Accuracy = 78%
            
            Many of the classification differences between the two datasets were associated with confusion between the L1 system (limnetic) and L2 system (littoral) as well as confusion between aquatic bed (AB) and unconsolidated bottom (UB) classes. The limnetic-littoral boundary is generally defined by the 2-meter depth contour by the Cowardin system; however, data on water body depth is not universally available, so differentiating between these systems is difficult to do with precision. The difference between AB and UB systems is based on the presence macrophytic aquatic vegetation. Differentiation between these two classes is confounded by the dynamic nature of vegetation patterns. If these two classes of error are excluded from the analysis, the overall photo-interpreted wetland classification accuracy for the updated NWI would be 86%.
            
            FIELD ACCURACY
            
            The NWI is a map product derived from remote sensing. While remote sensing methods are the only practical means of wide-area mapping, these methods are somewhat limited in their ability to detect and classify certain feature types compared to a field-level assessment. To provide additional information regarding the reliability of the NWI for field-level use, the data were also compared to a set of validation data points mostly derived from field efforts. The Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis Laboratory at the University of Minnesota collected 915 field-based validation points in the summer of 2010. Sample points were located using a stratified-random sampling process. All field data were reviewed by the DNR wetland monitoring coordinator to check for obvious data errors. A ground-level assessment was made of wetland class and GPS coordinates were acquired using a Trimble Juno field computer. The geographic coordinate data were differentially corrected to improve accuracy. An additional 168 points were added by photo-interpreting high-resolution stereo imagery and other ancillary data to compliment the field data and ensure complete spatial distribution across the project area. 
            
            The mapped wetland class (polygons) was associated with the validation class (points) using a spatial join process in ArcGIS. The distance to the nearest wetland class boundary was calculated for each point. Points inside of the combined 95% confidence interval of the positional uncertainty of the imagery and the GPS were excluded (5.64 meters). The data were compared at two classification levels: level one compares the level of agreement between the two data sets for a two-class system of wetland versus upland, and level two compares the agreement between the data sets for the Cowardin wetland class-level. The producer's accuracy, the user's accuracy, and the overall accuracy were calculated for the level one (wetland-upland) classification. The level-two (Cowardin class) assessment calculated the overall accuracy.
            
            Wetland-Upland Accuracy
            Wetland Producer's Accuracy = 89%
            Wetland User's Accuracy = 97%
            Overall Wetland-Upland Accuracy = 89%
            
            Wetland Class Accuracy
            Overall Wetland Class Accuracy = 72%
            
            As with the comparison to the PI points, many of the difference between the field classification and the mapped classification are related to the L1/L2 system and AB/UB classes. If these two classes of error are excluded from the analysis, the overall field wetland classification accuracy for the updated NWI would be 84%.
            
            2) SOUTHERN ACCURACY TESTING
                            
            The data were compared to an independent set of validation points to assess their quality and accuracy. Validation points were selected by a stratified-random sampling process, classified through a field review conducted by the University of Minnesota, and reviewed by the DNR using 0.5-meter resolution imagery, 1-meter LiDAR derived digital elevation models, and other ancillary data. The mapped wetland class was associated with the validation class using a spatial join process in ArcGIS (points to polygons). 
                                    
            Points within 5 meters of a wetland boundary were excluded to prevent potential positional uncertainty in the field GPS and base aerial imagery from leading to apparent errors in classification accuracy. For the wetland-upland classification accuracy (level one) this left 2210 validation points for testing. For tesing of the Cowardin class accuracy (level two), points within 5 meters of a class boundary were excluded along with all upland points, leaving 481 wetland-only, validation points. The producer's accuracy, the user's accuracy, and the overall accuracy were calculated for the level one (wetland-upland) classification. The level-two (Cowardin class) assessment calculated the overall accuracy.
                                    
            Wetland-Upland Accuracy
            Wetland Producer's Accuracy = 89%
            Wetland User's Accuracy = 94%
            Overall Wetland-Upland Accuracy = 94%
                                                
            Wetland Class Accuracy
            Overall Class Accuracy = 83%
                                    
            Many of the classification differences between the two datasets were associated with confusion between the L1 system (limnetic) and L2 system (littoral) as well as confusion between aquatic bed (AB) and unconsolidated bottom (UB) classes. The limnetic-littoral boundary is generally defined by the 2.5-meter depth contour by the Cowardin system; however, data on water body depth is not universally available, so differentiating between these systems is difficult to do with precision. The difference between AB and UB systems is based on the presence macrophytic aquatic vegetation. Differentiation between these two classes is confounded by the dynamic nature of vegetation patterns. If these two classes of error are excluded from the analysis, the overall photo-interpreted wetland classification accuracy for the updated NWI would be 86%.

                Step 1 - Field Data Acquisition
                Field training data for photo interpretation projects is extremely important in order to guide the interpretation.  The field training data for the east-central project area served three purposes: 1) provided field experience for staff members updating the Minnesota NWI in the local wetland identification and classification, 2) gathered images for use in a guidebook for wetland photo interpretation, and 3) collected training data for the creation of a potential wetlands layer using a Random Forest? classification.   Within the project area, 12 quads with wetlands representative of those found in the project area were selected for field verification.  These quads included urban, residential, and rural areas.
                
                Step 2 - Image Segmentation
                The input to the eCognition segmentation process is a tiff layer stack and the raw spring 2010 aerial imagery.  The NED 10 meter DEM was resampled to 3 meter resolution after the derived products were created.  The SSURGO soils derived products were converted to raster format and added in the stack.  All layers were clipped to the spring 2010 aerial image boundary.  The final tiff layer stack consisted of the following layers:
                1) Combined Curvature
                2) Planimetric Curvature
                3) Profile Curvature

                9) SSURGO Water Regime
                10) DEM
                
                Step 3 - Random Forest Classification
                The output of the segmentation process consists of two shapefiles; a polygon shapefile of the segments and a point shapefile of the centroids of the polygons.  The polygons and points were related using a unique identification number (ID).  The point file contains all of the descriptive information from the polygon segments and was used as the input into the random forest classification.  Topology was built for the image segments and any issues are corrected.  Additional fields (attribute, comments, field verified) were added to the image segments for the photo interpretation process. A random forest classification was run using the point file and training data (described in section 6 above).  The random forest classification classified each point based on the training data and assigned a confidence value to each classification.  The resulting classification was then joined to the polygons using the unique ID.
                
                Step 4 - Photointerpretation
                The classified segments were then used to enhance a more traditional photo interpretation of the imagery.  Each of the segments was viewed, edited (merged with neighboring segments of the same class or cut to exclude an area), and assigned a final NWI classification using a variety of imagery and data.  A custom object inspector was created to incorporate the information from the random forest classification as well as the soils and Radar classifications.  Once a quarter quad was completed, the segments were dissolved based on NWI attribute and run through a quality control process that checks for overlaps, gaps and approved NWI codes.
                
                Step 5 - Draft Data Review
                The draft version of the NWI classification for the quarter quad was sent to the MN DNR for review.  Once the review was completed, the quarter quad was merged into a seamless state-wide layer.  The final NWI layer for the east-central project area was projected to Albers equal area projection for delivery to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

                These data underwent a minor revision between July 25, 2014 and August 8, 2014. Requested edits since the initial release of the data were compiled into a geodatabase. The data steward reviewed 81 requested edits. Most of the edit requests were submitted by the USFWS National Standards and Support Team through a post-project review. Seventy-three (73) edit requests were accepted and eight (8) edit requests were rejected. Of the accepted edit requests, 53 of these involved adding small wetlands or parts of wetlands (min = 0.03 acres, max = 10.5 acres, mean = 0.89 acres) that were missed in the initial release, four edits involved a change of wetland class, and 16 edits involved a deletion of some portion of a wetland (min = 3.5 acre, max = 10.6 acres, mean = 0.66 acres).
                The geometry of the updated data were checked using the Check Geometry tool from ArcGIS and any errors found were fixed using the Repair Geometry tool. A topology was created and the data were checked for gaps and overlaps. All gaps and overlaps were resolved. Finally, the USFWS QAQC tool was run on the data.
                
                2) SOUTHERN REGION

                          Step 1 - Field Data Acquisition
                          Field training data for photo interpretation projects was acquired to guide the interpretation.  The field training data for the southern project area served two primary purposes; 1) provided field experience for staff members in identification and classification of local wetlands, and 2) gathered images for use in a guidebook for wetland photo interpretation signatures. Approximately 470 wetland sites were visited over three separate excursions (spring 2013, fall 2014, and spring 2014). Sites were selected using the following criteria; 1) representative of the variety of wetland types and imagery signatures, 2) spatially distributed across the entire project area, and 3) consideration of site accessibility.                  
                                            
                          Step 2 - Data Preprocessing
                          The MNDNR Resource Assessment Office generated several derivatives from the lidar and soils data as an aid in photo-interpretation. These data were provided to SMUMN along with MNDNR spring aerial imagery from 2011 and FSA summer aerial imagery from 2008, 2009, and 2010. Data derivaties included:
                          1) Slope 
                          2) Curvature
                          3) Topographic Position Index
                          4) Compound Topographic Index
                          5) SSURGO Hydric Percentage
                          6) SSURGO Water Regime
                                            
                          Step 3 - Wetland Delineation and Classification
                          Working in county-level tiles, photo-interpreters systematically panned through the imagery looking for identifiable wetland signatures. Wetland boundaries were digitized wetland boundaries on-screen primarily using the spring aerial imagery and lidar data in ArcGIS. Each polygon was assigned a wetland classification using a variety of imagery and other ancillary data. Once a work area (county tile) was completed, the attribute for the simplified HGM class was added. 
                                            
                          Step4 - Initial Quality Control
                          Photo-interpreters performed frequent self reviews, checking for errors. This was followed by review by a QAQC specialist. The data were checked to ensure only allowable wetland classes were assigned. Features smaller than the minimum mapping unit were deleted or merged. Adjacent polygons with the same class were merged. The entire data set was visually inspected at 1:10,000 scale to look for classification errors using a system of signature matching. Linework was reviewed at 1:5,000 scale. An automated topology check was performed to identify and fix errors such as gaps and overlaps.
                                            
                          Step 5 - Draft Data Review
                          The draft version of the NWI classification were posted via web-mapping service for the MNDNR and other project stakeholders to review. Review comments were forwarded to SMUMN to address. Additional field checks were performed for selected sites to provide additional feedback to the photo-interpreters.
                                            
                          Step 6 - Final Processing
                          Once the review was completed and any required edits made, the data from the county tiles were edge-matched to create a seamless coverage for the entire project area. The NWI verification tool from the USFWS was run on the data repeating many of the automated checks previously performed. All identified errors were fixed and then the final validation was performed.
