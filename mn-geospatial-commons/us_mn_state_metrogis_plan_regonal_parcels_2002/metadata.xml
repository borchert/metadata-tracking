The seven counties were assembled into a common coordinate system.  No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties.  A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county.  Not all attributes are populated for all counties.

This is an annual version of the MetroGIS Regional Parcel Dataset that can be used with other annual versions to do change analysis and time series investigations.  This dataset is intended to contain all updates to each county's parcel data through the end of 2002.  It was originally published as the "January 1, 2003" version of the dataset.  See the Currentness Reference below and the Entity and Attribute information in Section 5 for more information about the dates for specific aspects of the dataset.

Some counties have also made available a parcel points dataset that includes the same attribute fields.  This is done to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon.

This is a MetroGIS Regionally Endorsed dataset.  

Each of the seven Metro Area counties has entered into a multiparty agreement with the Metropolitan Council to assemble and distribute the parcel data for each county as a regional (seven county) parcel dataset.</abstract><purpose>To view, analyze and display historical parcel data anywhere in the seven county metro area.

CARVER:  The Horizontal Accuracy of the counties parcel dataset is, for the most part, UNDER 1' accuracy. This is possible because the County's Surveyor used COGO (Coordinate Geometry) which is a highly accurate way of plotting parcel lines. 

DAKOTA:  90% less than 2.0 feet 

HENNEPIN:  Estimated to be +or- 2 to 4 feet at section corners. Positional accuracy decreases with distance from section corners.

RAMSEY:  Digitized information is generally +or- 7 feet; some areas have been found to be +or- 30 feet. Cogo (coordinate geometry) accuracy generally is +or- 1.0 foot. 

SCOTT:  No information provided.

WASHINGTON:  Digitized features outside areas of high vertical relief (e.g. major river valleys) tested 23 feet horizontal accuracy at the 95 % confidence level using National Standard Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA).

Digitized features within areas of high vertical relief tested 120 feet horizontal accuracy by other testing procedures. 

All other features are generated by coordinate geometry and based on a framework of accurately located PLSS corner positions used with public information of record. Computed positions of parcel boundaries are not based on individual field surveys. Although tests of randomly selected points may show high accuracy between field and parcel map content, variations between boundary monumentation and legal description of record can and do exist. Caution is necessary in use of land boundary data shown. Contact the Land Management/Land Survey Division for more information.</horizpar></horizpa></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srcscale></srcscale></srcinfo><procstep><procdesc>Each county provided parcel polygons and attributes in shape file format to the Metropolitan Council.

            (PINs).  It is new to the MetroGIS Regional Parcel Dataset with the 
            January, 2003 update.  At this time, most counties do not populate 
            this field.  Values are:

            0 = not available or not provided
            1 = Valid Parcel (single taxpin)

                polygon dataset)
            3 = One of multiple parcel points that together are represented by 
                a single polygon (only valid in point dataset)
