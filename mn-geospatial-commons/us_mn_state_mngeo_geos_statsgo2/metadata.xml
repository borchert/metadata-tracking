It was developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey and supersedes the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) data set published in 1994. It consists of a broad based inventory of soils and nonsoil areas that occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. The data set was created by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more detailed soil survey maps were not available, data on geology, topography, vegetation, and climate were assembled, together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like areas were studied, and the probable classification and extent of the soils were determined.

Map unit composition was determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize the whole map unit.

This data set consists of georeferenced vector digital data and tabular digital data. The map data were collected in 1-by 2-degree topographic quadrangle units and merged into a seamless national data set. It is distributed in state/territory and national extents. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System data base which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.

Data were collected as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the state, regional, and national level. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:250,000-scale data.

The Digital General Soil Map of U.S. was designed primarily for regional, multicounty, river basin, State, and multistate resource planning, management, and monitoring. Data are not detailed enough to make interpretations at a county level. This soil survey product is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting or siting decisions, but may be used as a reference source. The use of these data is not restricted and may be interpreted by organizations, agencies, units of government, or others; however, they are responsible for its appropriate application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps for purposes related solely to state or local regulatory programs.

When data from the Digital General Soil Map of U.S. are overlayed with other data layers, such as land use data, caution must be used in generating statistics on the co-occurrence of the land use data with the soil data. The composition of the soil map unit can be characterized independently for the land use and for the soil component, but there are no data on their joint occurrence at a more detailed level. Analysis of the overlayed data should be on a map polygon basis.

Additional political, watershed, or other boundaries may be intersected with the soil data. Although the composition of each political and watershed unit may be described in terms of the soil map units, information is not available to assign the components to the boundary units with full accuracy. As with the land use categories, the analysis should be restricted to the classified components.

The approximate minimum area delineated is 625 hectares (1,544 acres), which is represented on a 1:250,000-scale map by an area approximately 1 cm by 1 cm (0.4 inch by 0.4 inch). Linear delineations are not less than 0.5 cm (0.2 inch) in width. The number of delineations per 1:250,000 quadrangle typically is 100 to 200, but may range up to 400. Delineations depict the dominant soils making up the landscape. Other dissimilar soils, too small to be delineated, are present within a delineation.

Digital enlargements of these data to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only.

Data values for some data elements may be incomplete or missing. Where data are unavailable, a mask should be used to exclude the area from analysis.

The spatial and tabular data used to create this product are periodically updated.

All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in the signed classification and correlation document and amendments and are current as of the date of digitizing.</attraccr></attracc><logic>Certain node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements. (The GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing the limits of the file (neatline) are free of gaps. The tests of logical consistency are performed using vendor software. The neatline is generated by connecting the explicitly entered four corners of the digital file. All data outside the enclosed region are ignored and all data crossing these geographically straight lines are clipped at the neatline. Data within a specified tolerance of the neatline are snapped to the neatline. Neatline straightening aligns the digitized edges of the digital data with the generated neatline (i.e., with the longitude/latitude lines in geographic coordinates). All internal polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e., adjacent polygons with the same label). Quadrangles are edge matched within the state, merged into a statewide data sets, and then edge matched to adjacent state data sets. Edge locations do not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.</logic><complete>A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named the same in terms of their soil and/or nonsoil areas. Each map unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and is uniquely identified. Each individual area is a delineation. Each map unit in the Digital General Soil Map of U.S. consists of one to more than 21 components.

In those few areas where detailed maps did not exist, reconnaissance soil surveys were combined with data on geology, topography, vegetation, climate, and remote sensing images to delineate map units and estimate the percentages of components. Map unit components in this product are soil series phases, and their percent composition represents the estimated areal proportion of each within a map unit. The composition for a map unit is generalized to represent the statewide extent of that map unit and not the extent of any single map unit delineation. These specifications provide a nationally consistent representation of the associated attribute data.

The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit delineations were based on statistical analysis of transect data. The composition was largely determined by measuring transects on detailed soil survey maps. The number of transects used was proportional to the relative size, number, and complexity of the delineations. The combined data on the length of the map units crossed by the transects were used to determine the percentages of the different soil and nonsoil areas in each map unit.

Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey Standards and procedures were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map units. These standards are outlined in U.S. Department of Agriculture. 2nd Ed., 1999. Soil Taxonomy: A basic system of soil classification for making and interpreting soil surveys. Nat. Res. Conserv. Serv., U.S. Dep. Agric. Handb. 436.; U.S. Department of Agriculture. 9th Ed., 2003. Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Soil Surv. staff, Nat. Res. Conserv. Serv.; U.S. Department of Agriculture. Current Issue. National Soil Survey Handbook, title 430-VI. Soil Surv. Staff, Nat. Res. Conserv. Serv.; and U.S. Department of Agriculture. 1993. Soil Survey Manual. Soil Surv. Staff, U.S. Dep. Agric. Handbook 18.

Adherence to National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality control is outlined in documents that reside with the Natural Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist.</complete><posacc><horizpa><horizpar>The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their compilation to base maps that meet National Map Accuracy Standards. The difference in positional accuracy between the map unit boundaries in the field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The locational acuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies with the transition between map units.

For example, in areas where changes in soils, climate, topography, and geology occur subtly across a portion of a state, the transition between soil map unit boundaries will be gradual. Where these features change abruptly, such as from an area of foothills to a lake plain, the transition will be very narrow. Soil delineation boundaries were digitized within 0.01 inches of their locations on the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched between data sets. The data along each state boundary are matched against the data for the adjacent state. Edge locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.</horizpar></horizpa><vertacc><vertaccr>N/A</vertaccr></vertacc></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srcscale>250000</srcscale></srcinfo><procstep><procdesc>Source materials:

1. Multiple soil survey publications from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) provided base information for development of map unit delineations and transect data for naming map units.

2. Multiple reconnaissance, county, and State general soil maps from NRCS provided reference information for development of map unit delineations and transect data for naming map units where detailed surveys did not exist.

3. 1:250,000-scale stable-base material maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provided base materials for compilation of map unit delineation linework.

4. Multiple compiled mylar overlays of map unit delineations, unpublished, from NRCS were used as a digitizing source.

5. The 1994 State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) data base, from NRCS was used as source material of soil map unit delineations and soil symbols.

6. The 2005 National Soil Information System (NASIS) data base from NRCS provided attribute (tabular) information.

Process steps:

Map unit composition was determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed soil maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize the whole map unit.

Soil map unit lines and symbols were drafted in red pencil on a mylar overlay that was punch registered to fit the mylar USGS 1:250,000-scale topographic quadrangle. A detailed and complete edit was performed on all overlays before digitizing. The soil delineation overlays were raster scanned at a scanning resolution of at least 0.01 inches and converted to a vector format or were manually digitized on a digitizing tablet with a resolution of at least 0.001 inches. Four control points corresponding to the four corners of the quadrangles were used for registration during data collection. The control points were either explicitly entered or developed by the software. The data sets were edge matched and merged into statewide coverages. A detailed and complete edit was performed on all digital data.

The National Soil Information System data base was developed by Natural Resources Conservation Service soil scientists according to national standards.

State coverages were merged into a seamless national coverage. This reduced tabular data redundancy and polygon number. A detailed and complete edit was performed on all digital data.

The Natural Resources Conservation Service State Soil Scientist or delegate verified that the labels on the digitized soil map units link to map units in the tabular database, and certified the joined data sets for release to the Soil Data Warehouse. A system assigned version number and date stamp were added and the data were copied to the data warehouse. The tabular data for the map units and components were extracted from the data warehouse and reformatted into the soil data delivery data model, then stored in the Soil Data Mart. The spatial data were copied to the Soil Data Mart without change.

The tabular data were extracted from the Soil Data Mart without change. The spatial data was exported to an ESRI shapefile.

The Natural Resources Conservation Service State Soil Scientist or delegate, upon completion of data quality verification, determined that the tabular data should be released for official use. A selected set of map units and components in the soil survey legend was copied to a staging database, and rating values for selected interpretations were generated. The list of selected interpretations is stored in the database table named sainterp.</procdesc></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><indspref></indspref><direct>Vector</direct><mgmg3obj></mgmg3obj><mgmg3til>State</mgmg3til></spdoinfo><eainfo><overview><eaover>Map Unit Delineations are closed polygons that are geographic mixtures of groups of soils or soils and nonsoil areas.

The map unit key uniquely identifies each closed map unit delineation. Each map unit key is linked to a map unit symbol and a map unit name. The map unit key is also the key for linking information in the National Soil Information System tables.

Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil Information System data base. This attribute data base gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties for each soil. The data base contains both estimated and measured data on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation, agronomic, woodland, range and wildlife uses of the soil.

The National Soil Information System data base contains static metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these data base objects. Attributes include table and column descriptions and detailed domain information.

The National Soil Information System data base also contains distribution metadata. It records the criteria used in the set of distributed data.

AREASYMBOL:  A symbol that uniquely identifies a single occurrence of a particular type of area (e.g. Lancaster Co., Nebraska is NE109).

MUSYM:  The symbol used to uniquely identify the soil map unit in the soil survey.

MUKEY:  A non-connotative string of characters used to uniquely identify a record in the Mapunit table.

SPATIALVERSION:  A sequential integer number used to denote the serial version of the spatial data for a soil survey area.</eaover><eadetcit>U.S. Department of Agriculture. 2nd Ed., 1999.
