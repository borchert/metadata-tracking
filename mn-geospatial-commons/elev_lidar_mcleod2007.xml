Bare-earth and first-return LiDAR data divided into 5000' X 5000' sheet tiles named according to the Lower Left XY coordinate value in LAS format. Five foot posted raster bare-earth DEM divided into 5000' X 5000' sheet tiles. Raster DEM in ArcGrid format, Countywide breaklines compiled as needed using synthetic stereopairs generated from the LiDAR intensity data in ESRI file geodatabase and ESRI shape file format.

The LiDAR data for McLeod County was collected under contract by the county. Thus, the data format is not entirely consistent with some of the other LiDAR data collected by the State of Minnesota. Specifically, the McLeod County collect required classification of only Bare Earth in the LiDAR LAS files, so there is no information on buildings, vegetation, or model key points.

The LAS data used for this process were acquired from the U.S. Geological Survey.

No breaklines were available for processing this data.

A surface was generated from the bare earth LiDAR DTM and the collected breakline data to produce one-foot contours and raster DEM at a 5-foot resolution.</logic><complete>Data collection of the survey area resulted in a total of 124 flightlines including re-flights and supplemental flights as well as four control lines covering the project area. The range files, flight logs, raw air and ground GPS files were then processed using REALM, a LIDAR processing software package from Optech. Processing began by downloading these files into a REALM database. For redundancy and accuracy purposes, the airborne GPS data were processed from two base stations using POSGPS from Applanix, Inc. The agreement between a minimum of two solutions checked or combined between a minimum of two stations was better than 10 cm in each of X, Y, and Z. These trajectories were used in the processing of the inertial data. The inertial data were processed using POSProc from Applanix, Inc. This software produces an SBET ('smooth best estimate of trajectory') using the GPS trajectory from POSGPS and the roll, pitch and heading information recorded by the POS (Position Orientation System). REALM uses the SBET to generate a set of data points for each laser return in the LAS file format. Each data point is assigned an echo value so it can be segregated based on the first and last pulse information. This project's data were processed in strip form, meaning each flight line was processed independently. Processing the lines individually provides the data analyst with the ability to QC the overlap between lines. </complete><attracc><attraccr>LiDAR DEM Quality Control Report</attraccr></attracc><lineage><procstep><procdesc>Vendor Processing Steps:

Strips were imported into a project using TerraScan (Terrasolid, Ltd.) and the project management tool GeoCue (GeoCue Corp.). By creating a project the various flightlines are combined while breaking the dataset as a whole into manageable pieces. This process also converted the dataset from geographic coordinates to the Minnesota County Coordinate System (NAD83), McLeod Co utilizing NADCON. The ellipsoid height values were converted to NAVD88 orthometric values using Geoid03, provided by NGS. Individual lines were then checked against adjacent lines to ensure a cohesive dataset. The data from each line were then combined and a classification routine was then run to determine the initial surface model. This initial surface model was then reduced using Optimal Geomatics' proprietary methods to create the final bare-earth dataset. A Triangular Irregular Network (TIN) was generated using the final surface data. Contours were then created from the TIN. The bare-earth data were then checked against the validation points across the project area. The results of these checks showed the DEM fitting the validation points well (see LIDAR DEM Quality Control Report for results). Stereo pairs were generated from the LIDAR intensity data using Geocue and LIDAR1CuePac (Geocue Corp.). LIDARgrammetry was then utilized to collect breaklines where necessary along hydro features to support the contour generation. These breaklines were collected as a 3D element in the MicroStation (Bentley Systems, Inc.) environment utilizing ISSD (Z/I Imaging). The deliverables constituted: LIDAR bare-earth in .LAS format, LIDAR first-return in .LAS format, raster bare-earth DEM in ESRI ArcGRID format at 5-foot resolution, and an ArcGIS File Geodatabase containing one-foot topographic contour data, breaklines, and control points as 3D feature classes. 


Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Processing Steps:

1) LAS files were projected from County Coordinates to UTM Zone 15, NAD83
2) LAS point Z values were scaled from feet to meters
3) LAS files were retiled into the state tile scheme (1/16 of a USGS 1:24,000 scale quadrange)
4) Breakline features were merged together into a single feature class
5) Breakline features were projected from County Coordinates to UTM Zone 15, NAD83
6) Breakline Z Values were scaled from feet to meters
7) LAS Bare Earth Points and breaklines were used to create a Terrain data type 
8) 1-meter DEM was derived from Terrain using natural neighbors interpolation option (DEM01)
9) Hillshade was derived from 1-meter DEM (DEM01HS)
10) 3-meter DEM was derived from Terrain using natural neighbors interpolation option (DEM03)
11) Hillshade was derived from 3-meter DEM (DEM03HS)
12) Aspect was derived from 3-meter DEM (DEM03ASPECT)
13) Slope in degrees was derived from 3-meter DEM (DEM03SLOPE_DEGREES)
14) Slope in percent was derived from 3-meter DEM (DEM03SLOPE_PERCENT)
15) DEM03 was smoothed using a 3x3 mean smoothing filter 
16) 2-foot contours were created from the smoothed 3-meter DEM


All processing was done using ArcGIS V10 and LP360 Extensions
