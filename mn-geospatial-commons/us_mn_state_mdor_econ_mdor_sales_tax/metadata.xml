      <abstract>This spreadsheet includes Minnesota sales tax information for the years 2003-2009.  Data includes total amount of sales tax collected (state, county, city, and special purpose levies) and the number of businesses in the geographic area.  

Data are unduplicated and reported in one of four general categories:

1. Records outside of Minnesota are reported at the state level and include territories, APO's, foreign and unassigned.

Within Minnesota, records are assigned to one of three geographic levels (blockgroup, city or county):

2. Within the 7-county Twin Cities metro area, records are assigned to blockgroups.
3. Outside of the 7-county Twin Cities metro area, records are assigned to cities with populations greater than 2,000 residents.
4. All other unassigned Minnesota records are tabulated by county.

Note:  The positional accuracy of many locations for years 2003-08 has been improved in this version, therefore, anyone using this data should download and replace any previous version.</abstract>

      <current>This data begins in the 2003 tax year, for taxes filed in 2004, and is current to the 2009 tax year, for taxes filed in 2010. Further updates are on hold due to a problem caused by a change in census block group boundaries in 2010. The change could make it possible to reverse engineer the data by splitting some of the old and new block groups in order to get more precise tax numbers as they pertain to a particular business; a way needs to be found to prevent this possible data disclosure.</current>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Attributes are deemed accurate but not error free. This data is administrative in nature and may be misrepresentative due to changing filing requirements or other administrative functions.

Records are assigned to the respective geographic area through geocoding of the listed address on the filed tax return, thus introducing an unknown, presumably small, level of error to the data through incorrect addressing.  

It must also be noted that this dataset ONLY covers sales tax, and does not include the use tax or other forms of taxation. These figures do include total sales tax, which includes the state portion along with any county, city, and special purpose levies.  It does not include nor factor into the aggregated figures any information about businesses who failed to pay Minnesota sales tax.    Please visit the Sales Tax page on the Minnesota Department of Revenue's website for additional information on filing requirements and guidelines:  http://www.revenue.state.mn.us/businesses/sut/Pages/File-and-Pay.aspx

IMPORTANT: The 7 records listed for the 7 metro counties are each the total of unmatched tax returns for those counties and are NOT the aggregate for each county. The 7 counties are: Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington.

Geographic areas with fewer than 10 businesses have been suppressed to ensure compliance with privacy laws.</attraccr>

    <complete>The entire state of Minnesota is included.

      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Geographic boundaries are taken from U.S. Census Bureau TIGER files for 2008: http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html

Individual records are linked back through previous years in order to provide better positional precision.  For example, if a point for 2008 is a rooftop match, and the address hasn't changed since 2003, the same blockgroup is assigned to all intervening years, even though the 2003 match only provided the city.</horizpar>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Addresses, taken from the Minnesota Sales Tax forms, are geocoded using a variety of software packages, including MapMarker (MapInfo), EDQ (FirstLogic), and ZP4 (Semaphore).  Problematic addresses, such as those on a boundary of two geographic areas, are manually assigned to a geographic area by Minnesota Department of Revenue staff.

The total number of returns for each geographic area are then used to compute the total amount of collected sales tax and the total number of businesses.

Data from geographic areas with fewer than 10 businesses is then suppressed to comply with privacy laws.

Additional processing step added in 2010:  Individual records are linked back through previous years in order to provide better precision.  For example, if a point for 2008 is a rooftop match, and the address hasn't changed since 2003, the same blockgroup is assigned to all intervening years, even though the 2003 match only provided the city.  Therefore, anyone using the data should download and replace any previous version.</procdesc>
