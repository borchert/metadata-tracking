ZCTAs are aggregations of census blocks that have the same predominant ZIP Code associated with the addresses in the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File (MAF). Three-digit ZCTA codes are applied to large contiguous areas for which the U.S. Census Bureau does not have five-digit ZIP Code information in its MAF. ZCTAs do not precisely depict ZIP Code delivery areas, and do not include all ZIP Codes used for mail delivery. The U.S. Census Bureau has established ZCTAs as a new geographic entity similar to, but replacing, data tabulations for ZIP Codes undertaken in conjunction with the 1990 and earlier censuses.</abstract><purpose>The Metropolitan Council downloaded this dataset for purposes of mapping data it collects by zip code.</purpose><supplinf>Twin Cities 7 County Metropolitan Area.

This  ZCTA cartographic boundary file is a selected generalized extract from the Census Bureau's TIGER geographic database designed for use in a Geographic Information System (GIS) or similar mapping system. It has been developed for various internal Census Bureau projects and have been made available here to the general public on an "as is" basis. 


Cartographic Boundary File Formats

Cartographic boundary files available from the Census Bureau's web site are available in the following formats: 
ARC/INFO EXPORT (.e00) format
ArcView Shapefile (.shp) format
ARC/INFO Ungenerate (ASCII) format 


Scale and Generalization 

The cartographic boundary files are primarily designed for small scale, thematic mapping applications at a target scale range of 1:500,000 to 1:5,000,000. 

The cartographic boundary files are a generalized extract from the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER database. Line simplification/smoothing was performed with a tolerance of 0.005 decimal degrees and a coordinate reduction using the Douglas-Peucker method with a tolerance of 0.0003 decimal degrees. Very small polygons were eliminated when the combination of geographic codes existed elsewhere. The geography was clipped back to the shoreline of the United States, in contrast to TIGER/LineÂ® which shows the full extent of geography out to the 3-mile limit. 

These generalized cartographic boundary files are originally produced to support the spatial geographic infrastructure for certain mapping functions within the Census Bureau's American Fact Finder and in support of the LandView Geographic Data Viewer. The generalized files have a much smaller file size than the original file extraction from the Census Bureau's TIGER database, resulting in faster download and processing times. 

Limitations 

Because of coordinate thinning:
Cartographic boundary files should not be used for geocoding; 
Some offshore, redundant, zero population and housing land areas may be absent from the files; 
Cartographic Boundary files are not necessarily vertically integrated with previous boundary file sets.</complete><lineage><procstep><procdesc>Shapefile Dataset copied from  U.S. Census Bureau Cartographic Boundary Files from 2000 Census for 5-Digit ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs): 2000
