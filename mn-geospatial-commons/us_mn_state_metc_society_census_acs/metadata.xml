Data collected over the most recent 5 years are batched, summarized and published the following December.   Summary tables compiled with 5-year data have approximately 20,000 variables from 900 tabulations. The published Census statistics have been recompiled by Metropolitan Council, with custom field names, in order to accomplish definitional and categorical consistency between Census 1990, Census 2000, and ACS.</purpose><supplinf>This dataset covers Minnesota and Western Wisconsin.
