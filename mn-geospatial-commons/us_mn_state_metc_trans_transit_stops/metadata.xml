      <abstract>The Transit Stops layer contains over 18,000 active and inactive transit stops in the Twin Cities seven county metropolitan area.  Stops where boarding and/or alighing occurs are flagged in the busstop_yn field.

The dataset includes attributes from the primary transit stop database maintained for Metro Transit and for customer information for other transit provider transit services.  The locations are mapped referencing NCompass Technologies Inc. street centerline network along with streets generated internally at Metro Transit.  </abstract>
      <purpose>To identify all stop locations in the Twin Cities metropolitan area where transit service exists. </purpose>
      <supplinf>Twin Cities 7 county metropolitan area.  This includes the counties of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington.</supplinf>
