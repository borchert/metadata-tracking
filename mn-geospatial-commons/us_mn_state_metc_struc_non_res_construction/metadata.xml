Respondents are asked to provide project information for new buildings and additions to buildings if permit valuation is $100,000 or more.  Data does not include permits for work such as plumbing, mechanical, reroofing, etc. or if the project is for remodeling only (not involving a new structure or adding square footage to an existing structure).  

Data on square footage and value should not be used to attempt to determine value per square foot, as not all projects include data for both variables.

A small number of communities each year may not provide data.  These are typically places with no nonresidential construction occurring.

The data on returned surveys were verified by Metropolitan Council staff through various means including: contact with community staff, community websites, and comparison to data in the Council's Service Availability Charge (SAC) reports where possible.  

For this data, projects are counted at the time local units of government issue building permits. No information on demolitions is included, so the data represent a gross construction volume, but not the net gain in property value or space. With subsequent annual updates, the data should be useful for assessing  longer-range trends.

Multiple building permits may be issued for a given project, separate from the permit for the major structural work, for example, for foundation work, mechanical, electrical, and finishing work. Metropolitan Council has attempted to represent the permit valuation and square footage for all new projects and additions (if over $100,000) and to avoid duplicate reporting of these. However, there may be some inconsistency because of the complexity of some projects and differences among local permit record-keeping systems. Where it was possible to differentiate,  permits that were for remodeling, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and finishing work only have not been included.

Project 'value' reflects the estimated cost of construction reported on the building permit. Permit values exclude some costs including land and landscaping, and are typically lower than market values of completed properties.

City-to-city comparisons may not be entirely valid if there are differences in survey completeness or methods of permit valuation.

Other construction activity may have occurred on properties of state and federal jurisdictions that are not included in this report. The University of Minnesota, for example, is not covered in Metropolitan Council's survey since it does not have to apply for building permits from local jurisdictions.

Occasionally a project will be put on hold after the building permit has been issued. All permits reported by local officials for this survey are included in our data base and in this report, regardless of status. It would not be feasible to do continuous follow up of all projects through the construction process.

Council Research staff designated each listing as "Commercial," "Industrial," or "Public or Institutional", based on descriptive information provided by survey respondents.  The Public or Institutional category includes government-owned structures and semi-public buildings such as hospitals, schools, churches and community centers, owned or occupied by nonprofit organizations (including religious). All schools were coded as Public or Institutional use, whether ownership is public or private.

The Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport is not within the boundaries of a minor civil division. The Metropolitan Airports Commission provided data on airport construction.

YEAR:   The year the permit was issued.

BLDG_NAME:  The name of the building, developer or owner of the building.

BLDG_DESC:  A description of the building's use.

SQF:  Square footage of building or addition.

PERMIT_VAL:  Permit value of building or addition.

PERMIT_TYP: N= new; A= addition

Pin:  Parcel Identification Number.

Address: Address of building.

Zip_Code:  A system of 5-digit codes that identifies the individual Post Office or metropolitan area delivery station associated with an address.

CO_CODE:   3 digit FIPS and state standard county ID code
                        003 = Anoka County
                        019 = Carver County
                        037 = Dakota County
                        053 = Hennepin County
                        123 = Ramsey County
                        139 = Scott County
                        163 = Washington County     

CTU_CODE:   5 digit FIPS55 'Place' code for CTU.  As of 2006  these codes have been officially retired by the  federal government.  They are replaced by the GNIS codes below. The Census Bureau will continue to
create FIPS55 Place codes for new cities and townships through the 2010 Census.  After that, no new FIPS55 codes will be created. Note that for townships that wholly incorporate into cities, the same FIPS55 code for
the former township will usually be used for the new city. Conversely, GNIS creates a new ID for the new city. 

CTU_ID:   The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) official federal unique identifier for each city, township or unorganized territory. 

COCTU_ID:  11 digit identifier for the combination of county and CTU (concatenation of CO_CODE and CTU_ID_CEN).   This is the official U.S. Census Bureau format. 

CTU_NAME:   Name of the city, township or unorganized territory, e.g. Benton Twp., Blaine.

NonRes_Group: Designates project into 3 types.

NonRes_SubGroup: Designates project into 12 types.

NonRes_Type: Designates project into 24 types.
