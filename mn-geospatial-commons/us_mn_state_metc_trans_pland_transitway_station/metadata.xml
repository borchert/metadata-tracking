Currently, the file includes planned stations locations for those transitways where stations have been identified through a local process including: Southwest LRT (Green Line Extension), Bottineau LRT (Blue Line Extension), Cedar Avenue BRT Future Stages (Red Line), I-35W BRT (Orange Line), Gateway BRT (Gold Line), Red Rock BRT, and planned A Line Arterial BRT stations.

Stations and station points are placed at locations that generally represent the latest official project action by the lead agency. For transitways in early design, this could be as generalized as a point at the intersection and this file is not a guarantee of future station locations until they are under construction or in operation. 

The point dataset was created by using heads-up digitizing referencing aerial photography. 
When transitway construction is completed and service begins, the stations will move from this file to TransitwayStations (existing).  

Additional Notes: 
-Rachel Wiken is main contact for stations which are not part of the ABRT System.

- The A Line stations at Snelling &amp; Como will be located on the exit ramps, not in an online configuration as shown. The purpose of the current point is to show that there will be stations at Snelling and Como Avenues. 

- Downtown Minneapolis and Saint Paul BRT station locations have yet to be determined. Stations shown are conceptual.

STATION:   The name of the transitway station.

****A Note about Bottineau Light Rail Stations**** 
Selection of either a Golden Valley Road Station * or Plymouth Avenue Station * will be made in the future based on information from environmental impact review, engineering, and public involvement. 

X:  The longitude in decimal degrees.

Y:  The latitude in decimal degrees.

Name: Name of the route which is served by the station

Type:  Type of route served by station

Transitway:  Transitway name

Milestone: Station Milestone Status - the transitway / station status as moves from initial planning to development to engineering and finally construction. Operational transitway stations are moved to another dataset “TransitwayStations” 

StationID: Existing shared station IDs match the StationID field in the TransitwayStations file.
Planned stations are labeled 900 and above.  Arterial BRT stations are labeled 999 until operational.
