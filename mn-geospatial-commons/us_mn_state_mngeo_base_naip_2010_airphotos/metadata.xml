      <abstract>This data set contains 3-band natural color imagery from the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP). NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of ortho imagery within one year of acquisition.

The source files are 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy of within +/- 5 meters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ's) from the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP) or from NAIP. The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. NAIP imagery is formatted to the UTM coordinate system using NAD83. NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.

This file was generated by compressing NAIP imagery that cover the county extent. MrSID compression was used. Target values for the compression ratio are (15:1).

(Note: The Minnesota Geospatial Information Office (MnGeo) has created this metadata record to describe the entire NAIP2010 dataset, using information from Farm Service Agency metadata. Each county file is accompanied by the original FSA metadata for that county.)</abstract>
      <purpose>NAIP imagery is available for distribution within 60 days of the end of a flying season and is intended to provide current information of agricultural conditions in support of USDA farm programs. For USDA Farm Service Agency, the 1 meter GSD product provides an ortho image base for Common Land Unit boundaries and other data sets. The 1 meter NAIP imagery is generally acquired in projects covering full states in cooperation with state government and other federal agencies who use the imagery for a variety of purposes including land use planning and natural resource assessment. NAIP is also used for disaster response often providing the most current pre-event imagery.</purpose>

    <useconst>The Aerial Photography Field Office asks to be credited in derived products.

If defects are found in the NAIP imagery during the warranty period such as horizontal offsets, replacement imagery may be provided. Imagery containing defects that require the acquisition of new imagery, such as excessive cloud cover, specular reflectance, etc., will not be replaced within a NAIP project year.

Redistribution conditions:  In obtaining this data from MnGeo, it is understood that you and/or your organization have the right to use it for any purpose.  If you modify it, you are encouraged to apply responsible best practices by documenting those changes in a metadata record.  If you transmit or provide the data to another user, it is your responsibility to provide appropriate content, limitation, warranty and liability information as you see fit.</useconst>

        <procdesc>Aerial Services, Inc. (ASI) utilized Leica Geosystems Flight Planning Evaluation Software (FPES) to create the flight planning for the digital camera flights.  The flights were flown at an average flight height of 23,730 feet above ground with a 75cm gsd.  Each line had 25% sidelap with the adjacent lines.

Navaho, Cheyenne and Commander aircraft were used on the project.  The planes carried Leica digital camera ADS80-SH82 systems with sensors SN1300, SN1301, SN1324, and SN1318.  Each camera has been calibrated by Leica.  Certification and calibration data is on file at Leica Geosystems.

ADS80-SH82, SN1300 certification number: 763806_1300_090130-1.
ADS80-SH82, SN1301 certification number: 763806_1301_080926-1.
ADS80-SH82, SN1324 certification number:  763806_1300_100216-1.
ADS80-SH81, SN1318 certification number:  763806_1318_091209-1.

Each line is approximately 12,000 pixels wide and 200,000 pixels long.  The Leica camera collects 11 bands of imagery at 16 bit.  ASI extracts 3 bands of panchromatic for use in the aero-triangulation.  Four nadir bands - red, green, blue, near infrared (RGBN) are extracted to be used in rectification. Each camera uses Novetel OEM4 GPS units to collect internal measurement unit (IMU) data.

Upon completion of flight lines the imagery is reviewed in the field/office to ensure it meets contract specifications.  ABGPS/IMU data is processed using Leica IPAS Pro and GrafNav programs.  The aero-triangulation was completed with the ABGPS/IMU data only.  Pass-points were generated at 5% intervals along each line and 7 regions across each flight line.  Tie-points were generated at 5% intervals with 2 regions between flight lines.  Analysis of report documents as well as visual inspection along imagery line overlaps are completed to ensure accuracies of the aero-triangulation.

Thirty-meter national elevation data (NEDs) were downloaded from the USGS Data Gateway website for use on this project.  No corrections or changes were made to the NED data.  Ortho rectification was completed using Leica XPROsoftware version 4.2.  The NEDs were used for the elevation data in the ortho production.  An initial review of the raw orthos against control points was completed at this stage.  Eighty-nine control points were used as check control on the project.  Of those, fifty-eight points were supplied by the USDA from the 2008 Minnesota NAIP project.  The remaining points were collected from secondary sources in the project state.  A final accuracy check was completed on the final DOQQS.  The root mean square error (RMSE) values will be determined at the project completion.

Once the data passed accuracy requirements, Inpho OrthoVista (4.4) was used for seaming the ortho lines together and adjusting the tones of the imagery.  The DOQQs were cut and renamed directly from OrthoVista program.  At this stage the DOQQs are output as 8 bit imagery.  Once the DOQQs were cut, a batch file was used to assign the majority date of the DOQQ imagery to the file name.  Contractor made all attempts to match tone requirements of the project.  Variations of the ground cover may cause some deviation from the specifications.  ASI designed a batch routine to check and adjust the tones of each DOQQ to the desired tone values.  DOQQs and compressed county mosaics (CCMs) were reviewed in either Erdas Imagine or ESRI ArcMap.  Each data set was reviewed for tone, artifacts, seamline issues, and accuracy.

Lizardtech GeoExpress (7.0.3) was used to create the CCM image file.  Each mosaic was made with RGB bands and has an approximate 1:15 compression level.  CCM metadata was created using Arcmap and routines from our database.  Erdas Imagine is used to insert headers into the files and create the aux files for the data.  Exported dxf seamlines from OrthoVista were taken into ArcMap to generate seamline polygons.  Each polygon was populated with the required attributes.  CCM data was written to CD/DVD using Gear Software.  DOQQs were transported on internal hard drives.</procdesc>
