    <descript>
      <abstract>This dataset contains leaf-off 4 Band, red, green, blue, infrared (RGBI) digital orthophoto imagery of Chisago, Isanti, Sherburne and Wright counties in east-central Minnesota. It was produced at half-meter (50 cm) resolution from new aerial photography captured in Spring 2010.

Funding for this data was provided by the Minnesota Natural Heritage Fund, the Minnesota Clean Water Legacy Act, and The Environmental and Natural Resources Trust Fund. 

This metadata record was created by MnGeo using information supplied by Surdex Corporation.</abstract>
      <purpose>The orthophotos will be used by the Minnesota DNR to update the National Wetland Inventory maps and as a base layer for mapping wetlands and other business needs. This type of leaf-off photography is a critical component for a variety of land management applications including transportation planning, wetland mapping, urban planning, forest management, soil mapping, and utility siting.</purpose>

    <complete>Half-meter project area was scaled back in early April due to rapidly changing foliage conditions on the ground site.  The state elected to delay acquisition in the southern project area until leaf-off 2011.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>An overall accuracy for this product was targeted for 2.4 meters, CE95.  Surdex collected Airborne GPS data at the time of image acquisition and supplemented with several control points surveyed by ground crews.  Surdex used these ground control points and additionally some QC points dropped out of the Triangulation in order to validate the accuracy of the final digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQ) product. Of all the points collected, only 20 were easily readable in the final product and were used to calculate the stated residual.  0.85, value in meters, CE95.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>Multiple aircraft were deployed to east central Minnesota in early April 2010 for digital image acquisition during leaf-off conditions. Cessna Conquests equipped with Intergraph DMC (Digital Mapping Cameras) captured 4 band imagery over the project sites. Imagery was captured at an altitude of 16,500 feet above mean terrain, allowing up 5% cloud conditions per frame. All four bands (RGB natural color plus near infrared) of raw camera data was processed using Intergraph PPS software coupled with Surdex proprietary image handling software for color correction and dodging. Post processing of Airborne and Ground GPS data was performed with Waypoint Consulting's GrafNav software.  Aerial Triangulation was completed using Intergraph ImageStation Automatic Triangulation and rectification of imagery to the state supplied 10 meter digital elevation model (DEM) was completed using Surdex proprietary software. Image mosaicking, QC and final DOQQ products were produced using proprietary Surdex software.</procdesc>
